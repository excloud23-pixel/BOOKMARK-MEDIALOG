1
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,040
Hmm...

2
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,460
—Hmm—

3
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:33,220
O

4
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,630
pened it—

5
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:34,930
Yeees!

6
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:36,870
So then,

7
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:39,350
today, we'll be practicing as Team Bird, okay?

8
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,150
I'd like to do that.

9
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:44,770
No waaay~

10
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,070
First off,

11
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,590
let's start with quick self-introductions.

12
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,050
Starting from the top, please—Risu!

13
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:50,830
Should we start with the seniors?

14
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,700
Me first?—Hello!

15
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,289
Poro poro

16
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:55,550
Kanba Rissu

17
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,360
I'm Ayunda Risu,

18
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,350
from Hololive ID's Gen 3.

19
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,380
Nice to meet you all—

20
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,860
Nice to meet you—

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,280
Volume seems fine too.

22
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:05,840
I see.

23
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,038
I'd appreciate it if you could let me know.

24
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,080
Seems alright, I think?

25
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,720
Awa awa awa awa

26
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,300
OK OK! Next up, Kiara-senpai, please!

27
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,280
Kiki Ariki, Hololive English's Takane Kiara here!

28
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,600
I'm probably the only non-bird in this group.

29
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,030
That's true.

30
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,920
Yeah, definitely.

31
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,240
But since this is my first time playing this game,

32
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,060
I'm a total beginner—sorry about that!

33
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,270
Please take care of me—please take care of me!

34
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,490
Please take care of me!

35
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,260
Looks good.

36
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,740
Next, Pekora—hope that's okay?

37
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,430
I came over from Team Wind as a skater!

38
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,710
That's Pekora—Peko, Pekora also

39
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,170
kinda, um, mixed it up with another game

40
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,690
and confused it with a different one

41
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:55,470
There are similar ones, right? Yeah, yeah!

42
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,630
I thought it was that one

43
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:02,130
and now I'm like, 'Oh no, oh no!'

44
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,690
But Risu-chan and Kiara-chan,

45
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:05,870
and Suu-chan are here,

46
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:06,510
so we'll definitely be fine!

47
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:07,590
Let's absolutely win!

48
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:11,030
Let's all win together!

49
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,670
Nice to meet you all!

50
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,850
Spish—I'm Suu Minato!

51
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,630
Suu's also a complete beginner,

52
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:20,650
so today I want to try my best

53
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,579
while learning lots from Senpai Risu!

54
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:25,570
Nice to meet you all—!

55
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,870
Nice to meet you—!

56
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:28,950
Yoshi yoshi yoshi

57
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:35,270
Preparations—Ah, never mind, gather here!

58
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,350
Ah, right here!

59
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:36,870
Okay!

60
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,250
Let's give it a try first.

61
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,970
Let's just try it out and see how it goes.

62
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:41,630
So first,

63
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,050
Yeah.

64
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,070
Yeah, yeah.

65
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:44,670
Since everyone's suited for different roles, I'm sure

66
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:46,450
Alright!

67
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:47,750
What's this?

68
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:51,250
Let's ask Risu-chan for help with everything.

69
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,490
There are couples here and there, but

70
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:53,350
Huh? What does that mean?

71
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,090
What even are these couples?

72
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,550
Couples are, umm…

73
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,490
Customers?

74
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,090
Ah, customers!

75
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:04,810
Yeah, couples mean two people

76
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,280
coming together as a pair, right?

77
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,120
I get it now.

78
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,300
Okay!

79
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:09,560
Got it!

80
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:13,810
So, umm…

81
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,760
Is this the prep area?

82
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,459
Prep

83
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,800
What are they even doing?

84
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,300
Preparation

85
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:31,110
Easy movement patterns

86
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:33,850
meaning we should arrange things for easier movement, right?

87
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,270
How should we go about that?

88
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,090
Risu-chan, where should

89
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,980
we position ourselves to make it easier?

90
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,290
What makes it easier...

91
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:46,940
How about a burger, then?

92
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,760
Maybe here?

93
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,620
This place is fine.

94
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:55,900
With this, okay?

95
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,840
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

96
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,040
Hey, Pekora, why...

97
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,100
Why isn't this human?

98
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:01,600
Do you understand?

99
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,440
Someone, why is this happening?

100
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,700
Why did Pekora turn into this machine?

101
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,300
Pekora, why don't you get it?

102
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,980
Why can't you just be human, no matter what?

103
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:11,980
What is this thing?

104
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,140
I could choose my favorite.

105
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:14,260
That...

106
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,700
I didn't choose it! I didn't choose it!

107
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,825
Seriously, I didn't pick anything—what is this? What is this?

108
00:05:18,825 --> 00:05:21,410
Skates are shaped like this, apparently.

109
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:22,170
What's going on?

110
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:22,790
I don't know either.

111
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,830
Supposedly, if you hold the button down, it turns into a crane.

112
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,990
I held the button down for a bit.

113
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:31,130
I didn't press anything!

114
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,130
I wonder what's going on.

115
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,980
Once we start, we might not be able to go back.

116
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,870
No, we'll go back.

117
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,830
I'm pretty sure we'll go back, right?

118
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,670
Probably gonna be fine.

119
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,470
This is super fun—only one person!

120
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,990
Ah, it went back! It went back!

121
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,330
I was just riding it.

122
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:46,970
Huh?

123
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:49,390
How did it go back?

124
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,530
Hobby!

125
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:53,150
Use the controller.

126
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,330
Ah, it went back! It went back!

127
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:55,820
Thank you, thank you!

128
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,790
First, who's going to be who?

129
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,170
We should decide our roles beforehand.

130
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,320
Um...

131
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,660
I don't want to do the burger!

132
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,880
I don't want to do the burger!

133
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,080
I really don't want to do the burger!

134
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,840
That selfishness won't fly, Kiyotaka!

135
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,420
You just have to do the burger!

136
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,780
Follow me, secretary!

137
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,300
Follow me—even as a secretary, you gotta do it!

138
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,180
Very well! Yes, I'm listening, I'm listening!

139
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:25,560
Hello!

140
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,620
Good, good, good—okay, okay!

141
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,980
Okay, okay, okay!

142
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:29,500
It's cramped in here.

143
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,880
This place might be super cramped.

144
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,180
Looks tight anyway, huh?

145
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:34,700
You know...

146
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,700
Order!

147
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,580
So fast!

148
00:06:38,619 --> 00:06:39,380
Taking orders!

149
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:40,800
Yes!

150
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,160
Are you okay?

151
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,200
Trash is appearing—no trash should be made!

152
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,900
Rename Restaurant!

153
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,340
Why is someone standing outside alone?

154
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:53,910
Risu-chan!

155
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:54,560
This person...

156
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,180
Aren't they waiting?

157
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,470
Waiting!

158
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,180
Waiting! Waiting line!

159
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,330
I see.

160
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:00,680
I see.

161
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,380
It's already turning into chaos!

162
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,800
It's already turning into sara hara suke!

163
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,460
Tr

164
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,640
ash is being created!

165
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,360
Trash is being created!

166
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,519
Trash is being created!

167
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,040
This place is insane!

168
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:18,310
This place is insane! This place is insane!

169
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:21,130
Sorry!

170
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:21,270
Sorry!

171
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,200
Sorry like this!

172
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:28,440
The idiots are finally showing their stupidity!

173
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,440
Oh no!

174
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,160
The patty's in trouble!

175
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,480
I'm not even handling the patty!

176
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:35,810
Why is this happening?

177
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:36,700
People are waiting so much!

178
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,440
It's crazy—too popular, it's insane!

179
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:43,570
Game!

180
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:48,010
It might have changed!

181
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,090
This is the 4000th time!

182
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:52,990
First...

183
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,470
Got it on the first try, right? It's narrow here.

184
00:07:55,890 --> 00:08:01,570
It's narrow, narrow here, so maybe this spot?

185
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,030
Yes, yes, yes!

186
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:03,750
Let's go with that side.

187
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,850
Yes, let's do that.

188
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,150
Yes, let's do that. Let's put it here.

189
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:10,830
This spot is made for two people to fit, you know. It fits.

190
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:15,550
Do we really need to wash things like bread too?

191
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,150
If we don't wash them, we won't be able to call many people.

192
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:19,630
I see.

193
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,010
This comes off.

194
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:25,950
If it's around here, Suu and Kiara-senpai can come to wash stuff, so closer might be better.

195
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:27,940
Closer.

196
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:28,550
Where exactly?

197
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:29,910
This spot is fine.

198
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:30,170
Probably.

199
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,830
They should be able to come wash things.

200
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:37,950
Who's in charge of burgers?

201
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:41,730
If it's about making burgers, I might be okay.

202
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,250
Just one person.

203
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:47,050
Risu-chan handles burgers.

204
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,510
And washing...

205
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,010
Washing dishes.

206
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:52,350
Pecora will wash them. OK.

207
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:57,290
Taking orders, delivering food, and cleaning.

208
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:58,490
Let's all work together!

209
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,370
This might actually work.

210
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:03,180
Alright!

211
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,110
Perfect?

212
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,930
Where do they bring the dishes, I wonder?

213
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:07,839
They'll bring them here.

214
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,390
Here.

215
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:09,110
Right here.

216
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:09,810
The dirty ones.

217
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:11,280
Huh?

218
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,210
Puno's here.

219
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:12,770
So fast!

220
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:14,890
Way too fast!

221
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:16,180
Dishes!

222
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:16,490
Dishes!

223
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:17,519
Dishes!

224
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,220
Dishes!

225
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,250
Yes, yes, yes!

226
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:21,490
OK, OK.

227
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,270
Already put them down.

228
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:25,110
Still no dishes yet.

229
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:26,970
OK, OK.

230
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,080
That's fine!

231
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,310
Risu-chan as cook is perfect!

232
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:31,829
No...

233
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:34,980
Wait a sec—this is undercooked!

234
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,080
There's even undercooked stuff. Thanks!

235
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,720
Wash this! Wash this one!

236
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,480
Can't put it here—over here!

237
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,940
Which one do I wash?

238
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,240
Which one needs washing?

239
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,640
I'll put it here. Right here.

240
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,480
Thank you!

241
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Ah, oh no—the burger!

242
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,280
Bur-

243
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,110
-ger! I'll take it!

244
00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:55,590
Order key! Order key! Oh no!

245
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:56,950
Order key incoming!

246
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,730
Washing, washing—burger #1!

247
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:01,950
Tsukuda-san! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

248
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,250
Washing, washing!

249
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:04,270
Huh?

250
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:06,660
Um...

251
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,770
One order didn't make it in time.

252
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:14,140
Huh? Wait, it just got busy, right?

253
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:14,360
Huh?

254
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,760
This is bad!

255
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,720
This is tough.

256
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,140
This is bad!

257
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,080
Hold on a second!

258
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,660
Washing dishes is hard!

259
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,460
Should we stay closer?

260
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:27,920
Actually, here...

261
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,980
Coming all the way here to wash stuff...

262
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:33,720
Should dishwashing be done here?

263
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:34,300
Hmm...

264
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,640
Saraare, not there!

265
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,280
Um...

266
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:44,320
We can do it from here.

267
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,580
So it can be done from there!

268
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,080
Yeah, that's really good!

269
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,940
Maybe this spot?

270
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,280
If even one person escapes, it's an instant game over.

271
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,740
This is tricky!

272
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,860
This is seriously bad!

273
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,300
Plus...

274
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,560
Saraare is surprisingly tough too.

275
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,520
It was pretty tough, huh... Hmm.

276
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,480
Scarier than I thought!

277
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:17,370
Trash is also coming out onto the floor, so

278
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:21,790
I tried to clean the floor trash first, but

279
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,010
Maybe the waiters should handle it.

280
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:27,150
That's true.

281
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,090
Then, when Pekora has free hands,

282
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,090
Pekora will go.

283
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:33,010
OK OK OK, I'm already here.

284
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,680
There's no place to put it.

285
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,580
Can I put it there?

286
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,750
No, no, can't put it there—it's bad!

287
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,310
If you put it over here, then over there...

288
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,320
Bringing burgers~!

289
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,760
This is already bad.

290
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,920
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad!

291
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,980
When Risu-chan is cooking

292
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,760
and helping wash Pekolan's dishes,

293
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,100
Wait, what's going on?

294
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:01,460
Risu,

295
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,740
You're way too strong.

296
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,190
There are burgers!

297
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,290
There are burgers! Be careful!

298
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,240
Yeah.

299
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,520
Plates!

300
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,740
No plates! Here, plates—here!

301
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,660
Yes, yes, yes!

302
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,440
Is anyone around right now?

303
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,240
It's fine.

304
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,825
The store's running smoothly.

305
00:12:24,825 --> 00:12:25,610
Alright~

306
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:27,530
It's running well, yeah.

307
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:28,530
Ah, forever and ever and ever

308
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,400
Cleaning, cleaning—ah, this is bad!

309
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,550
This person—ahhhhhh!

310
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,500
What are you doing?

311
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:41,870
Higher—eh, what was that?

312
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,010
The level just finished was way too high.

313
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:48,190
I probably don't get it.

314
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:50,930
Don't get it, don't get it.

315
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:52,310
The level was just so incredibly high.

316
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:53,090
Why though?

317
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,750
Why did we just die?

318
00:12:58,630 --> 00:12:58,990
Again!

319
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,490
We couldn't keep up with the orders.

320
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:01,370
It was too fast, right?

321
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:02,030
That couple...

322
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,020
Something...

323
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:03,630
One of them...

324
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,710
Right when one raised their hand,

325
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,930
it felt like things suddenly sped up.

326
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:10,450
I wonder what's going on.

327
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:11,830
Maybe we should've waited until both were ready before serving.

328
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,700
Can't we get more plates?

329
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:13,860
This...

330
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,960
Aren't there too few plates?

331
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,430
The number of plates is really low, isn't it?

332
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,810
It's too few, right?

333
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,230
Wait, hold on.

334
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:22,850
Risu-chan, please take a look.

335
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:24,740
Any points for improvement?

336
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,730
Did you have any advice or suggestions?

337
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:27,470
Like, maybe

338
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:29,090
'You should do it like this here,'

339
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:29,910
or something like that?

340
00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:35,400
Washing the plates—the plates...

341
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,160
From here, it's somehow barely

342
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,600
manageable.

343
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,720
Starting from here, from here...

344
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,040
Let's just do it here, then.

345
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,260
It's doable from here.

346
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,880
While also doing that?

347
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,880
Is it okay if I move it a bit?

348
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,380
It's kind of far, but would it get in the way?

349
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,240
Well, anyway...

350
00:13:59,060 --> 00:13:59,600
It's in the way.

351
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,500
Would it be in the way?

352
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:02,800
We can do it.

353
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,880
Let's try doing it closer.

354
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,640
This spot is in the way.

355
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,160
It was too far and we couldn't make it in time.

356
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,500
Let's make this into a large two-person table.

357
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,280
This and this will be big

358
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,740
two-person tables. I see.

359
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,440
Just two people is enough?

360
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,790
Customers basically only come in pairs.

361
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,010
But sometimes groups of four show up.

362
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:35,030
Group sizes are mostly 1 or 2 people.

363
00:14:35,569 --> 00:14:37,290
But this is too far away,

364
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,410
and we couldn't keep up multiple times earlier,

365
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:45,430
so we don't need it over there, right?

366
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:46,610
But

367
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:48,170
I feel like it was good just now

368
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,510
I think this part is totally fine

369
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,450
Easy to serve

370
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:54,930
Like, Kiara-san, I guess

371
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,150
When a couple comes

372
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,950
If you give the dish to just one of them

373
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:58,890
Probably

374
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,590
The other person will finish way too quickly

375
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:03,210
It might be better to serve them both at the same time

376
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,490
Oh, really?

377
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:07,550
Like, simultaneous serving, yeah, that's super

378
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,170
It got finished so fast

379
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,970
Simultaneous is probably better

380
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,330
Then

381
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:14,840
Give it to both people at once—ho, ho, ho

382
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,350
Alright

383
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,510
Let’s try it again once more—haaai!

384
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,790
Pekora will try even harder

385
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,430
Do your best!

386
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,940
First, here

387
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,560
So I don't get in Disu-chan's way

388
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,650
Such an intense review meeting

389
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:33,090
I need to respond, but

390
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:33,710
What’s going on?

391
00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:34,710
Yes

392
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,440
Two orders came in

393
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,050
It’s fine since they’re not a couple

394
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:43,150
Are you sure?

395
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:48,430
Why is the button response so slow?

396
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:53,100
Maybe someone threw the controller or something

397
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,240
And it broke

398
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,880
There’s definitely a chance

399
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,540
That might actually be the case from here on

400
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,380
The burger finishes cooking before the plate arrives

401
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,100
I seriously want that

402
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,780
Don’t act like you don’t know

403
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,140
This is bad

404
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:15,480
Go go go go, good good good—hmm

405
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,210
Yes yes yes yes, hello

406
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:23,530
Here—one each

407
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:25,250
This

408
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,370
Can’t wash the plates?

409
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:31,730
Ah, ah—this is the hot plate button

410
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,410
Why can’t this be washed?

411
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,470
Punishment

412
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,720
It’s washing

413
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,020
Plate washing is kinda slow

414
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,380
It’s slow, right?

415
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,520
Plate washing, plate washing—it’s slow, right?

416
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,580
You guys should start from the back there

417
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:55,790
Should do it from the free spot in the back

418
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,730
Plate washing is tough

419
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:01,190
They said if someone’s already using it, you can’t wash

420
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:05,170
Plate washer, hang in there, just a bit

421
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:13,069
Hand-washing—why, why is this so stupid?

422
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:14,250
One more, please

423
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:19,510
No no no—one more program, please

424
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:25,119
Seriously, one more program—hey, this

425
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:29,060
“Can’t wash”—what’s wrong with this thing?

426
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:35,060
This, Sara’s washing

427
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,100
Might need to switch once

428
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,400
Try it, Jio-san

429
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:45,510
Kiara will try

430
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,210
Kiara-chan, give it a try

431
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:50,330
She’ll definitely end up staying overnight like Pekora, seriously

432
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:51,090
Really?

433
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:55,209
It’s not just that Senpai Pekora is bad at it

434
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,990
It’s that the buttons don’t work well

435
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:00,570
I don’t think it’s Pekora’s fault

436
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:01,670
Maybe the response is just hard to trigger

437
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,110
Do I just carry the plates?

438
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,070
Yes, yes

439
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:05,270
OK OK

440
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,590
Just one game

441
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:10,170
They’re underestimating this

442
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:10,970
Orders

443
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,230
Yes yes yes yes, two came in

444
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,410
Two are ready

445
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,610
Send it over, Senpai Pekora

446
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,190
This one, Senpai Pekora

447
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:21,250
Huh?

448
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:21,570
Eh, what?

449
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:23,210
Something...

450
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:25,090
There's someone not working...

451
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:25,800
No

452
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,510
I am! I am working!

453
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,840
Huh, wait—maybe Pekora's lagging?

454
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,290
Maybe it's lagging

455
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,410
Might be lagging

456
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,050
Wha—

457
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:33,850
Wha—

458
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:35,890
My stomach's getting grabbed

459
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:37,050
People are getting exhausted

460
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:37,910
Wait, hold on

461
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:40,010
Senpai Pekora, please work

462
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:42,060
Pekora-senpai said she's working, right?

463
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:42,820
I'm doing it already!

464
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,030
I didn't come here as a spy

465
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:44,820
Hey, this

466
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,160
Wait, crap—this is lagging

467
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,400
Lag

468
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,080
No, that

469
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,120
I actually washed it normally

470
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,040
Kiara, that's wrong—it's lagging, lagging!

471
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,240
This thing from Japan is seriously lagging

472
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,040
I've been completely defeated

473
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,850
Indonesia's actually closer to Japan, and

474
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:05,100
Probably

475
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,780
Kiara might have the worst lag

476
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,350
Everyone doesn't know this, right?

477
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:13,549
It might be lagging—this is bad

478
00:19:13,549 --> 00:19:16,360
I can't place it, and furthermore, why

479
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,640
Why

480
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,020
What are you doing?

481
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,860
Seriously, seriously, no—I really mean it

482
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,140
This isn't spying

483
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,660
There really is a spy

484
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,120
Seriously, seriously, seriously

485
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,870
It's just one person operating, but

486
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:32,210
Hold on

487
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:36,110
I couldn't place it—but I did, I placed it

488
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,950
Suddenly Anime

489
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:38,330
Amazing

490
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:42,190
Wait a sec—this is seriously serious

491
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:45,870
No, no—hey, be careful, don't joke around

492
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:49,790
Seriously, please help me out

493
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,880
Pekora won't do anything about this

494
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,310
I'll wash it properly

495
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,360
Heave-ho

496
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,040
Seriously, seriously—this is weird

497
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,510
This

498
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:02,400
It's not like Pekora's doing that

499
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,760
Look, look—everyone's movements

500
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,840
Are weird, see?

501
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,500
I was acting a bit strange too

502
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,300
It rewound

503
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:11,520
Look

504
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,140
Pekora

505
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,490
It happened, it happened

506
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,109
This is bad—super funny

507
00:20:17,109 --> 00:20:19,250
Pekora-senpai can't do anything

508
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:19,830
Do your best!

509
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,050
Funny, it's alright

510
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,890
Sometimes things just go like this, right?

511
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:23,810
Yeah, sometimes it happens

512
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:28,870
Yosa-sakashi-iru oi sararan yan

513
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:30,090
The inside guy—oi sararan

514
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,330
You said 'sararan' earlier, right?

515
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:35,170
Senpai really should work—look

516
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:35,690
Senpai, look

517
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:36,870
Work already, come on

518
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:39,190
Well, sometimes you just get tired

519
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:39,770
What's this now?

520
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:49,610
Dangerous, dangerous—so dangerous!

521
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:51,190
This role

522
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,730
We actually managed it perfectly with the switch, didn't we?

523
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:54,370
Did it, did it

524
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,630
Yes, Kami

525
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:59,630
Kami, even beating the lag

526
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,370
This could work

527
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:03,550
By the way, seriously

528
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,210
Mizumi was solo-operating

529
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:07,050
Pekoro-senpai, no—that's not it, so

530
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:08,390
I was solo-operating

531
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:09,870
It was a bit laggy

532
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:11,070
Movements were bad

533
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,070
Even Pekoro with this

534
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:15,050
But still, we cleared it

535
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:15,890
True

536
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,470
What are we supposed to earn after clearing it?

537
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:20,290
What are we making into a team competition?

538
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:20,770
This thing...

539
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,720
How exactly do we compete?

540
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,580
In the end, what exactly are we supposed to do here?

541
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:29,240
Is there some kind of score that makes us better than the other teams?

542
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:29,720
This thing...

543
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,460
Speed or something?

544
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,200
Speed.

545
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:37,640
Uh, I wonder... probably speed?

546
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,010
It's probably speed, for now anyway.

547
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,750
Ah, like Day 2 or something like that.

548
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,810
What awareness are we trying to create?

549
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:46,630
Number of days.

550
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,010
Yeah.

551
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:50,850
It says 'number of days'—ah, so it's about days.

552
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:56,350
We need more tables.

553
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:59,750
Ah, so that means we can get more customers.

554
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,340
Should we give it a try?

555
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:05,270
That could work—if it's based on days,

556
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:10,270
then prep time counts too, right?

557
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:11,970
But maybe it doesn't matter.

558
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:12,850
Since it's not about speed.

559
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:18,250
I wonder if we can take as much prep time as we want.

560
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:20,090
That's true.

561
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:21,510
If it's only about days,

562
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,850
can we even add more sinks?

563
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:24,770
But we don't have any money though.

564
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:25,730
Money.

565
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,440
Did we just spend all our money on tables?

566
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,369
Yeah.

567
00:22:32,369 --> 00:22:34,800
Since Re-chan is already at the table,

568
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,200
maybe Mario can handle it?

569
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,140
Let me say it again.

570
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:39,920
Let me say it again.

571
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,500
As long as we work hard, it'll be fine.

572
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,960
There won't be any lag next time.

573
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,860
Leave it to me.

574
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,060
Do your best.

575
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,980
Because we're seriously going for the win.

576
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,960
Pekora's serious today, okay?

577
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,140
Even though she told us, 'Let's win!'

578
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,000
Pekora-senpai's acting weird too.

579
00:22:57,170 --> 00:23:00,810
This is A, right? Yeah, it's A.

580
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:03,060
Right? See, it's A.

581
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,370
It's working, it's working!

582
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:05,810
It's working—go ahead, go ahead!

583
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,860
It's working right now.

584
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:08,420
It's working right now.

585
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:09,620
With this,

586
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,100
we'll serve it as A.

587
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,000
See?

588
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,760
We're working, you know!

589
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:16,510
Work!

590
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:18,370
Sara-san,

591
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:20,970
you might not actually make it—you're surprisingly slow.

592
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:26,130
I'll deliver it! Right when it lights up!

593
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:26,590
Probably.

594
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:27,950
Like this.

595
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:29,510
X.

596
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:31,630
X?

597
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:35,550
Made it! You got it! We did it!

598
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:38,630
Yes, thank you very much!

599
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:41,910
It feels better than last time.

600
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:42,610
Smoothly.

601
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,030
Now! Now!

602
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:51,720
Ah, lagging, lagging, lagging—stop it!

603
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:52,740
Oh no!

604
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:58,360
Plates, plates, plates—might be in trouble, plates!

605
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,540
Might be in trouble.

606
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,340
Oh no, oh no, might be in trouble!

607
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:03,800
The plates...

608
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:08,050
Man, I really need another sink...

609
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:09,360
Hey, dish person!

610
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,240
What are you doing, Dish Person-chan?

611
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,580
Let's do this properly!

612
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,240
Huh? Pekora-senpai?

613
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,710
Didn't it take like 10 seconds just to get to the back?

614
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:20,760
Well, uh, Pekora-senpai was...

615
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,140
when you were doing the dishes,

616
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,120
you were working the whole time, right?

617
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:24,660
By the way,

618
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,200
No, no, Pekora-san,

619
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,300
Risu-chan-san,

620
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,340
Could you call her again?

621
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,300
Pekora-san might be super laggy.

622
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,880
Maybe I should restart this.

623
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,140
Yeah, I'll restart it. In advance...

624
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:41,100
If someone else is already making a room...

625
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:45,660
I'm not sure what'll happen to my level...

626
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,980
I don't know what'll happen if I try it.

627
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,680
Is it okay if I make a room?

628
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,520
Didn't they say there's a minimum level requirement?

629
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,620
I still think it's fine to make a room now.

630
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,490
Anything's fine, Rishan.

631
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:58,900
Could you call Pekora for me?

632
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,710
Because she'll be coming back.

633
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,220
Okay, I'll try calling Senior Pekora again.

634
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:06,440
Thank you.

635
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:13,390
But if the lag gets really bad...

636
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:19,320
Maybe someone else should create the room next time.

637
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:22,000
There's probably something like a level...

638
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,700
Only Senior Risu can probably open a Kampoofer room.

639
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,480
So it's only Senior Risu...

640
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,360
That's why...

641
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,720
Today, while leveling up...

642
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,160
Let's level up.

643
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,280
Tonight...

644
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,080
Let's make it so anyone can create a room.

645
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,300
Here comes Pekora—the hardest worker of them all!

646
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:38,820
She's here!

647
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,099
Let's go! Am I mistaken?

648
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:42,760
My memory...

649
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,060
Let's go, let's go!

650
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,140
Let's start!

651
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,680
Let's start! Work, work!

652
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:47,820
Yes, yes, yes!

653
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,850
Let's go!

654
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,889
It feels a bit better now.

655
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,690
Does Suu-chan's thing actually work?

656
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:01,920
It kind of...

657
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,120
It works!

658
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,820
It works! Does this menu item actually work?

659
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,460
Okay, okay.

660
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,359
Okay, okay.

661
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:08,740
Then, Bekoro...

662
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,340
This one person...

663
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,520
It works! Yes!

664
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,060
Yes, hellooo!

665
00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:15,060
I heard it.

666
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,200
I didn't hear it.

667
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,300
Please press the up button to hear it.

668
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:25,250
I heard it, I heard it!

669
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:27,170
Great, great!

670
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:29,510
Just a moment, please.

671
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:31,550
Let's influence things here.

672
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:31,910
The two of us...

673
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,530
Ready—go!

674
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:38,510
Right here—the up button...

675
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:39,590
I don't really get it, but...

676
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:40,490
I heard it!

677
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:44,010
You're doing a great job washing dishes—very nervously!

678
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:46,740
Speak up, come on!

679
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,430
Everyone, if you don't lend your wages...

680
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:49,949
We'll lose to the other teams!

681
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:50,650
Amazing!

682
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,910
Suddenly, energetic Senior Pekora...

683
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,710
I'll provide it to each of you individually.

684
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:54,970
Yes.

685
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:55,790
Provided to one person.

686
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:56,090
Thank you very much!

687
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:58,010
We're short two burgers.

688
00:26:58,010 --> 00:26:59,050
We're short two burgers.

689
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,320
Plates, please!

690
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,240
Then, these two...

691
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,700
Let's do it together!

692
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,740
But we're not a couple, so...

693
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,040
It's fine if you go ahead first.

694
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:08,520
Ah, okay!

695
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,520
Yes, OK OK OK OK—I'll bring it!

696
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:10,940
I'll bring it!

697
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,020
Yes, yes, here you go!

698
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,260
Here you are!

699
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,860
An order is coming in!

700
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:16,760
Thank you for your order!

701
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,080
How exactly are they hearing this...

702
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:19,800
I seriously don't get it.

703
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,120
Oh no!

704
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,640
This place is super dirty!

705
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,580
Seriously, it's gross!

706
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,140
Let's properly clean the floor.

707
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,000
I'll clean up.

708
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,280
Leave after you eat, hurry up and leave, customers too, quickly

709
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,850
Customers, leave too—don't stay forever!

710
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:40,360
There

711
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,100
Because we're a couple

712
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,740
We have to do two things

713
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,330
First, first, this side is fine

714
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:49,670
Down, let's go down first, OK OK OK

715
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:51,070
Leave after eating

716
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,530
Leave quickly after eating

717
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:53,290
Heave-ho, heave-ho

718
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,670
Heave-ho, heave-ho, heave-ho

719
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:57,370
Hey, wait—I just finished

720
00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:00,090
It's starting to look good—oh yeah!

721
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:06,050
This is the real deal—exaggeration works, it works!

722
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:07,390
Pecorasseppa, this one

723
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:08,370
Let's bring it together

724
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:11,930
Akeke—oh no, oh no, okay

725
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:20,640
Isn't it perfect? Amazing, beautiful!

726
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,300
It was hard to work, but it feels good now

727
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:29,820
Hey, can we buy plates?

728
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:31,890
What are we buying?

729
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:34,030
Can we buy plates?

730
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:35,070
Can we buy plates?

731
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,450
There's a pen on the envelope

732
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,080
Plate rack

733
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,640
There are plates

734
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,080
20 coins, 20 coins

735
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,680
We can buy sinks too, and plates

736
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,660
Both are good

737
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,380
Good, the sink is right here

738
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,420
What's a reservation desk?

739
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:03,320
Reservations are probably by phone

740
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:04,900
Phone

741
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,270
Don't we need a phone? No way

742
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:08,880
It's tough, after all

743
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:11,940
Day 3

744
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,340
We can do it anytime, really

745
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:18,080
We have extra money, so maybe we should buy something

746
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,720
Using an Xbox controller

747
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,819
Bought pink

748
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,940
Maybe I'll buy plates too

749
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,580
If I put this sink by this door

750
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,760
Maybe everyone can barely fit stuff here too

751
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,060
Indeed, from here

752
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:42,780
OK

753
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,460
Might work

754
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,240
It's responding—good, it works, it works!

755
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,380
Seems doable

756
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:49,740
Nice

757
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,900
Helpful! Nice, nice, nice

758
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,680
Let's give it a try

759
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,420
Let's give it a try

760
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,960
Let's go, let's go

761
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,140
The tasks won't change, right?

762
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:04,420
Yes

763
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:07,630
One customer has arrived—please come in!

764
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:10,200
Ah, it's two people

765
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:10,909
Two people

766
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:12,170
These guys surprised me

767
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:13,470
I thought it was just one person

768
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:15,010
Alright

769
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:18,110
Ah, sorry, sorry, ah

770
00:30:18,849 --> 00:30:20,670
Is the trash bin far?

771
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:24,490
Hey, maybe we can move the trash bin closer—it's crazy

772
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,310
Ah, crap! Ah, we won't make it in time—crazy!

773
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:32,340
Ah, sorry—it's fine, even pros mess up

774
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,639
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay

775
00:30:33,639 --> 00:30:34,960
It happens sometimes

776
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,079
I served it a bit too early

777
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:42,330
The chef must be under a lot of pressure

778
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:44,820
You can't afford to fail

779
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,410
Chef

780
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:46,190
Thank you

781
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:49,250
Alright, let's go

782
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,110
Let's go

783
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:51,960
Yes

784
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,260
Let's go

785
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:53,950
Let's go

786
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:54,360
Let's go

787
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,870
Welcome!

788
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,150
Plates!

789
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:02,370
Welcome, welcome—delicious!

790
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,200
Alright

791
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,680
Yes, okay, here they come, here they come, here they come

792
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,490
Yes, okay, it's come. Yes, go ahead.

793
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:08,970
Thank you very much.

794
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:10,350
Yeah, Zuwan, once you eat, you gotta go home.

795
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:11,490
Once you eat, you gotta go home.

796
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:12,710
Yes, one order of hamburger for one person.

797
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:13,550
One piece, right.

798
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:14,890
Don't mess up the route.

799
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:15,970
Don't mess up the route, okay.

800
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:17,810
Yes, this guy, okay.

801
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:18,510
Well then...

802
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,050
I'll take one hamburger.

803
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:21,660
Alright, alright.

804
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:23,730
Yes, once you eat, go home.

805
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:24,810
Once you eat, go home, you're heading back already.

806
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:25,770
Once you eat, go home.

807
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:27,050
Yes, Zu...

808
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,580
Wan.

809
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,060
Thanks a lot!

810
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,960
Okay, then I'll serve it now.

811
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,440
Serving.

812
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,020
Thank you very much.

813
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:35,680
Well then...

814
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,020
Moving on to the menu.

815
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,480
I'll serve it.

816
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:39,340
Nice!

817
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,560
A nice couple just arrived.

818
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:42,780
Ra...

819
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:43,740
Okay.

820
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:46,560
Washing dishes.

821
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:46,980
Washing dishes.

822
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:47,440
Just for a moment...

823
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,359
I'll leave this here for now.

824
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:48,860
So...

825
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:51,180
Senior couple, taking your order now.

826
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:52,840
Yes, going now.

827
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,100
Yes, okay.

828
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,520
Alright, I'm going now.

829
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,060
Okay.

830
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:58,150
Nice! Another couple again.

831
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:58,300
Ca...

832
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,200
-uple is super popular.

833
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,260
Couples love it.

834
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:03,500
Yeah.

835
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:04,880
Miss Woman's...

836
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:07,510
Heave-ho, heave-ho.

837
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:10,610
Alright, with this, let's go to the lower couple. Okay.

838
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:12,750
Entering the active phase.

839
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:17,540
Yes, while handling the fifth customer, nice job.

840
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,640
Nice! Five people quickly.

841
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:19,860
Alright!

842
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,760
Shift will end soon.

843
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,140
Alright, OK.

844
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,300
Ah, OK—plates!

845
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,900
Wash the plates properly like this, okay.

846
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:31,840
Please order only what you can finish.

847
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,760
Last order—one item only.

848
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,140
Yes, please go ahead. Okay.

849
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,680
Then, to Su-chan...

850
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,620
Was still entering it.

851
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:46,120
Right now, two more orders came in.

852
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,280
There's an order there.

853
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,720
I'm not really sure how to take orders—the bar's ready!

854
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,260
Bringing it now! Bringing it to the back!

855
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:00,450
Yes, here you go.

856
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:04,370
The bar's ready!

857
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:04,950
Feeling good, feeling good.

858
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,060
You'll get spoiled!

859
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,840
Clean it up~

860
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:18,550
Perfect! Amazing!

861
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,820
Not bad!

862
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:23,860
This place is the best! The absolute best!

863
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:27,960
Awesome! Great job! Oh, stars!

864
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:32,410
It's getting good reviews.

865
00:33:32,459 --> 00:33:34,850
Reputation improved, timing got better.

866
00:33:35,989 --> 00:33:37,270
No, that's great.

867
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:39,730
Working is fun, isn't it?

868
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:40,270
This, you see...

869
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:41,530
What's this?

870
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:45,170
We shouldn't add things like cherry pie, right?

871
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:46,530
Just burgers, right?

872
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:47,950
Exactly, exactly.

873
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:50,370
Well then...

874
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:52,350
We have no choice but to increase staff.

875
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:53,940
What do you mean by increasing staff?

876
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,190
More customers objectively means more guests.

877
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:58,090
This...

878
00:33:58,090 --> 00:33:59,030
How do you write a letter...

879
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:04,290
Dining...

880
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:10,150
Sink, sink, work boots.

881
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:12,690
Work

882
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:17,050
Easily open the shoe door

883
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:18,429
Move easily through crowds

884
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:18,969
Honda

885
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:19,989
Spreads dirt

886
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:22,708
Honda dirt

887
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,699
It ends up spreading the dirt, huh

888
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:26,820
That's probably not great

889
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,600
Add something?

890
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:38,219
The sink—here, sorry, Pekora

891
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:39,320
It's kind of hard to wash

892
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,699
I left dishes here

893
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:44,340
I briefly thought maybe Kiara was finding it a bit difficult

894
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:44,570
How about it?

895
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:45,040
Seems okay

896
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,620
Sometimes I leave dishes out

897
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,219
It was fine

898
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:49,080
Leaving them is totally fine

899
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,780
This side might be okay

900
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,760
You should be able to place things from outside too, just in case

901
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,159
But maybe it's a bit tight

902
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,420
This corner

903
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,700
Even from this angle

904
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,640
This door goes through, so you can place things through it

905
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,300
Okay, okay

906
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,880
Just go back like that—it'll make me laugh

907
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,720
Okay

908
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,020
Shouldn't we change something?

909
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,300
There's some lag

910
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,380
Uh, hey, hey

911
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:17,450
Laggy

912
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:18,750
Laggy

913
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:20,510
Ugh

914
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:23,489
Wait, Pecoro's running super smoothly right now

915
00:35:23,489 --> 00:35:23,950
Actually,

916
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:25,410
Ah, it just became smooth

917
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:25,910
Fixed!

918
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:28,600
Okay

919
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:28,740
Okay

920
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:29,020
Okay

921
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:31,400
Ah, we can recreate Blue Prince now

922
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,039
Even in this upgrade test

923
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:33,460
One more round

924
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,280
Should we keep it like this?

925
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,900
Yeah, let's try one round

926
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:38,540
Wait a sec

927
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:39,780
What's up?

928
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,260
Wait a moment, everyone

929
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,620
Ah, it's Suichan

930
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,060
The teacher came

931
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:46,660
The teacher came! The teacher!

932
00:35:47,959 --> 00:35:48,700
Sorry

933
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,040
Just a sec

934
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,620
I finished my errand

935
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,040
Welcome back!

936
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,620
A guest arrived!

937
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,520
The teacher came to help us

938
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,860
A pro came! A pro came!

939
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:58,600
We’re on a bit of a time limit

940
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,800
I have plans right after this, so...

941
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,220
I see

942
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,590
Is there someone who knows the details?

943
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:04,080
Plate up

944
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:06,910
No one? Maybe only Risu-san?

945
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:09,890
Only Senpai Risu—Risu knows best

946
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:12,490
Risu

947
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:14,730
Right now, with the hamburger

948
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:16,070
Together with the hamburger

949
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,440
So you've already started?

950
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,420
We've started

951
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah—that thing

952
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:26,710
Ah

953
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:28,380
We need to upgrade stuff like the dishwasher

954
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,700
Dishwasher

955
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,080
What's that?

956
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,360
Seriously?

957
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,160
Can we actually use upgraded versions?

958
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:35,190
We wash by hand at our place

959
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:36,940
You don't even wash by hand yourself

960
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,610
Do you understand the rules for this round?

961
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:39,810
Time, time

962
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:40,550
Huh?

963
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:43,410
I don't get it—time attack?

964
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:44,030
Time attack

965
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:46,950
The rule this time is time attack, right?

966
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,100
P-probably

967
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,500
I don't know, honestly

968
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,200
Wait, wait, wait!

969
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,820
Yeah, yeah, hold on a sec!

970
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:56,720
I'll go check real quick!

971
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,620
What's 'Time Attack'?

972
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:00,420
Does it mean finishing the day as quickly as possible?

973
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:01,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

974
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:02,980
Next, I'll set it right here.

975
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:03,940
Okay!

976
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:07,790
These are couples, right?

977
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:09,030
Two people as a couple, okay?

978
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:12,490
That was great, seriously!

979
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:14,090
If Suichan hadn't come...

980
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:14,490
Pekora and the others...

981
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:16,740
...would've been playing without understanding any of the rules.

982
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,110
Hey, listen...

983
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,090
While watching the stream...

984
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:21,870
I was wondering if you'd be alright...

985
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:24,950
But you were totally fine, weren't you?

986
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:26,430
It actually went pretty well!

987
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:29,740
But hey, your gameplay was super shaky!

988
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,550
Pekora!

989
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:31,550
Senpai, let's go as a couple!

990
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:31,930
Let's do it!

991
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:32,430
Couple!

992
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,240
Plate up!

993
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,040
Oh no!

994
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,220
The customers are already shouting 'Rules! Rules!'

995
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:44,060
Right now, if we could just serve one more plate...

996
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:46,580
Then this capo would go 'capo!'

997
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,070
Capo!

998
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,230
Capo!

999
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:51,050
Capo!

1000
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:53,770
Nice!

1001
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,030
Huh? Wait, so...

1002
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:59,460
Slither Senpai, is it only for one day?

1003
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,220
Ah, no, no, no, no!

1004
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:05,540
Um, there's a time limit...

1005
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:08,540
A 15-minute time limit, yes, yes, yes!

1006
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:14,580
You earn 50 points multiplied by the number of stages cleared within 15 minutes.

1007
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:23,400
So basically, you need to rush through as many stages as possible in those 15 minutes. For example...

1008
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,660
If you reach Day 5...

1009
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:28,270
That's 250 points!

1010
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:29,110
Exactly!

1011
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:33,950
So things like...

1012
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:38,030
...the time spent selecting items need to be done super fast.

1013
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,340
This too, huh?

1014
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,450
Is John Bee's Time Mode also like that?

1015
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:43,170
I see, got it!

1016
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:44,370
Right, and also...

1017
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:45,910
I think the map is predetermined.

1018
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:46,410
Map?

1019
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:47,630
Map?

1020
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:49,630
What's a map?

1021
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:53,890
Is the map not fixed?

1022
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:54,920
Well, um...

1023
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,170
It is fixed—the seed value is set.

1024
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,520
Right now...

1025
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,509
There are lots of rooms down in the bottom-left corner, right?

1026
00:39:02,509 --> 00:39:05,680
This shape of the store...

1027
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,590
This time, we won't use that area.

1028
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:12,790
Um, the top floor plan...

1029
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:14,090
You know this one, right?

1030
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:17,870
Next to it, there's a place where you can set the seed value...

1031
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:22,450
Enter the seed value 'CUDDLE'.

1032
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:23,210
Then...

1033
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:27,810
Could someone type 'CUDDLE' into the chat, please?

1034
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,560
Then, somehow...

1035
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,580
It should turn into the Hero Show room, I think!

1036
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:43,180
Would this side be easier to handle?

1037
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:45,460
Probably, yeah.

1038
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:48,640
This time, we'll use that setup, plus City...

1039
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,840
Not the right one—wait, the top-left one!

1040
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,500
City mode...

1041
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:54,300
And with those rules...

1042
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,140
Making burgers...

1043
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,860
...and seeing how quickly you can complete it within 15 minutes!

1044
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,820
Blade Up gives you various items, right?

1045
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,060
All sorts of...

1046
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:10,660
By evolving these items...

1047
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:13,320
...you can work more efficiently.

1048
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:14,960
Evolve!

1049
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,320
Currently, dishwashing...

1050
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,380
...is done by hand, but it can become a dishwasher!

1051
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,780
Like being able to wash four at once.

1052
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,880
How do you perform divine evolution?

1053
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,800
How do you wash it?

1054
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,060
You can only evolve once.

1055
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:31,779
If you clear on day one,

1056
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:34,940
you’re guaranteed to get an upgrade desk,

1057
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:35,780
and it will drop.

1058
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,860
There used to be something like an upgrade desk.

1059
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:42,439
You buy that upgrade desk,

1060
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,460
and there was something like a bookshelf, right?

1061
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:48,010
It’s guaranteed to be green,

1062
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:50,590
and there’s a bookshelf available from the start,

1063
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:55,570
so you can place it there without buying it.

1064
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:57,070
It dropped from that whistle,

1065
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:58,070
that square item,

1066
00:40:58,070 --> 00:40:59,910
so you place it there without buying it.

1067
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:02,210
Then start,

1068
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:04,510
and after you’ve started,

1069
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:07,790
keep smacking that upgrade desk repeatedly.

1070
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,930
When the gauge maxes out,

1071
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:11,660
it evolves.

1072
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,460
Maybe you should try it once.

1073
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:17,180
Unless you’ve started the game,

1074
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:18,340
you won’t be able to upgrade it.

1075
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:19,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1076
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,980
By the way, if you don’t mind,

1077
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:26,520
could someone share their screen?

1078
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:26,700
Please.

1079
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,700
Thanks, that makes things easier.

1080
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:30,540
I mean, it’s so huge,

1081
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:31,380
isn’t that kind of crazy?

1082
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,920
This one should be okay.

1083
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:33,060
This.

1084
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:36,210
I know how cramped it was before.

1085
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:37,570
Given that,

1086
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,899
does that make it easier to work with?

1087
00:41:39,899 --> 00:41:40,440
This.

1088
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,540
I liked the cramped setup too.

1089
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,440
I just shared my screen.

1090
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,320
Thanks.

1091
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,640
Well, but here,

1092
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,340
what’s with all this space?

1093
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,650
They arranged it so Ris-chan can move more easily.

1094
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:53,360
Huff, huff.

1095
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:53,540
Hah.

1096
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,660
But there’s another trick,

1097
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,260
Yeah, just now,

1098
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:58,960
you know the letter has arrived, right?

1099
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,420
And to go get that letter,

1100
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:03,020
you step out of the door,

1101
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:06,560
and you have to actually go over there.

1102
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,320
I believe on the controller,

1103
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,560
everyone is using controllers,

1104
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,960
or Beer-chan on the keyboard,

1105
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,460
hold B down,

1106
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,700
and something like a crane appears.

1107
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:19,410
Then,

1108
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:21,270
you can slip through that wall.

1109
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:22,110
By doing that,

1110
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:24,430
you can set things up a bit quicker.

1111
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:27,030
That’s why this exists.

1112
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:28,930
Exactly, exactly.

1113
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:33,850
Now, down below, there’s something green, right?

1114
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:36,770
Is this the bookshelf-like thing?

1115
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:37,190
This.

1116
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:39,130
Yes, yes, the document shelf, that’s it.

1117
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:43,110
Put the letter in there,

1118
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:47,170
and place the upgrade desk right beside it,

1119
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:50,070
and once it starts, go ahead and smack it repeatedly.

1120
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:52,830
It won’t show up until you’ve cleared the Reiwa stage once.

1121
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:54,330
I think it’s better to clear it first.

1122
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:56,160
Plus,

1123
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,200
since the map is large, the customers take longer to leave,

1124
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,840
because the time it takes for customers to leave is wasted.

1125
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:04,700
So, near the entrance, that table,

1126
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:07,440
collecting dining tables might be an option too.

1127
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,460
Ah, I see.

1128
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:10,240
Yeah.

1129
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:11,920
There are various options available around there.

1130
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:12,160
Options like that.

1131
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,160
Behind here, then,

1132
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,740
it’s better if no one is present.

1133
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:18,080
Guests take quite a while to leave, so you should head home early.

1134
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:18,380
Go home.

1135
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:20,920
So you mean placing it closer as part of our strategy?

1136
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,380
Yeah, that's totally acceptable now.

1137
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,320
That's great, Master!

1138
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,220
It was dangerous—they almost didn't make it in time.

1139
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:29,960
It really was dangerous; I'm truly satisfied now.

1140
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:30,940
We can do this.

1141
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:35,640
Actually, I've become even more anxious about various things...

1142
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:40,320
Thanks to the area manager coming, I feel a bit better now.

1143
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,400
We can do it.

1144
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:41,600
We can do it.

1145
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,960
Since we can practice from here on, we'll be fine.

1146
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:43,960
Yeah, yeah, we can do it, we can do it!

1147
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,219
If we have the knowledge,

1148
00:43:46,219 --> 00:43:48,039
we can apply it—okay!

1149
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:49,700
Okay!

1150
00:43:49,739 --> 00:43:50,800
I'll do my best!

1151
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:51,680
Alright, let's give it a try once.

1152
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:54,210
For now, I'll

1153
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:58,850
keep handling cleaning and plates and such.

1154
00:43:58,850 --> 00:44:00,140
Ah, the burger station is too far away.

1155
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:02,250
Wait a sec—oh, right!

1156
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:04,910
Ah, be careful! Yes, exactly, that's right!

1157
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:09,390
Let's also find an easier way to make this.

1158
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:10,390
Yes.

1159
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:12,840
Where should we put it?

1160
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,060
Nice, nice!

1161
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:15,580
Great!

1162
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:21,080
There are two spots by the window as well,

1163
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:24,210
so if possible, let's place the burger station at just one of them

1164
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:27,570
and clean only one spot

1165
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:29,670
or place the plates there.

1166
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,400
Unless there's no space, though...

1167
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,950
Let's make this side the dirty one.

1168
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:38,320
This side, closer to the sink.

1169
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:39,440
Yes.

1170
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,040
Let's go with that. And over here,

1171
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,900
the cooking side of the mixer

1172
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,800
could serve as the burger plating station.

1173
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:46,900
Wouldn't this side be better?

1174
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:49,270
I think that's good.

1175
00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:51,810
Alright, let's do it!

1176
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:53,650
Let's go!

1177
00:44:54,490 --> 00:44:55,410
Hey-yo!

1178
00:44:56,830 --> 00:44:58,530
Two customers have arrived.

1179
00:44:58,530 --> 00:44:59,570
A couple, a couple!

1180
00:44:59,610 --> 00:44:59,870
Hi!

1181
00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:00,690
Alice-chan!

1182
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:02,390
They might not actually be a couple...

1183
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:04,260
They're definitely not a couple.

1184
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:05,620
I couldn't hear that.

1185
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:06,260
Ah, I heard it! I heard it!

1186
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:07,540
Okay, okay, okay!

1187
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:08,400
Gok-gok, gok, gok-gok!

1188
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,240
Thanks for coming all the way in the rain!

1189
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,480
These guys are standing way too close together,

1190
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:14,840
making it kinda hard to pass through.

1191
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:15,620
Thanks for this!

1192
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:17,880
No problem!

1193
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:25,190
While cleaning here, day one...

1194
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:26,590
Isn't this way too relaxed?

1195
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:28,950
Can you hear me?

1196
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:30,730
At first, Pecorine and the others were in big trouble, though.

1197
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:34,410
Day one wasn't nearly as smooth back then.

1198
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:36,910
So there was a time like that, huh?

1199
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:38,230
Yep, yep!

1200
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:39,870
It just means we've gotten better.

1201
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:41,550
Now we're pros, after all—exactly, exactly!

1202
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:43,370
Aren't these guys making way too much of a mess?

1203
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:44,070
100%!

1204
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:53,830
I'll place the plates.

1205
00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:54,790
Thank you very much.

1206
00:45:56,350 --> 00:45:57,890
I'll place the plates.

1207
00:45:57,890 --> 00:45:58,090
And...

1208
00:45:58,970 --> 00:45:59,370
Yes.

1209
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:02,780
Yes, served successfully—nice job!

1210
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:05,030
Risu-chan's

1211
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:07,130
silent burger-making

1212
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:08,130
is way too fast—unbelievably fast!

1213
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:09,370
Isn't that seriously amazing?

1214
00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:10,570
Seriously, super fast!

1215
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:12,470
That's incredible!

1216
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:13,430
At this rate, they're definitely not a couple.

1217
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:15,690
Burgers keep coming out nonstop!

1218
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:16,170
Alrighty!

1219
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:17,750
Yes

1220
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:20,530
Yup, okay!

1221
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:22,030
The speed

1222
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:24,030
Yo-yoisho

1223
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:26,910
I'll take your order

1224
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:28,090
I'll place the order

1225
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:29,630
Thank you very much

1226
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:36,700
For now

1227
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:39,460
Day 1 is fine, no worries, okay

1228
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:45,540
Letters have started falling down

1229
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:49,500
As expected, I opened all the letters that came down

1230
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:51,920
Opened them by pressing hard on the bottle neck

1231
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:52,080
And then

1232
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,720
That sink and

1233
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:54,980
That upgraded desk and

1234
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:58,900
I really want to buy the upgraded desk first

1235
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,480
But I don't have enough money to buy it

1236
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:03,960
So I can't buy this on Day 1

1237
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:04,920
Or maybe I can buy it, but

1238
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,300
It's because of that issue with the customers

1239
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,540
Sui-chan, what's going on here?

1240
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:11,700
I think we should be able to buy it

1241
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:12,920
But why can't we buy it right now?

1242
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:14,160
Right now, I

1243
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,420
Haven't bought the phone yet, right?

1244
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:18,500
The very first phone

1245
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:19,920
We ignored it, didn't we? We ignored it

1246
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:22,520
Ah

1247
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,540
We should buy it

1248
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:25,660
We should get the phone

1249
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,779
Yeah, buy the phone

1250
00:47:27,779 --> 00:47:29,580
Then, ring the phone—'chirin chirin chirin chirin'

1251
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:30,100
When you ring it

1252
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,580
Customers will suddenly come pouring in

1253
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:34,500
Oh, really?

1254
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:38,180
And each time you ring 'chirin,' it's like 9 yen, I think

1255
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:38,740
If I remember correctly

1256
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:41,580
That's how it comes in

1257
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:42,800
You actually get quite a bit

1258
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,720
Every time you ring it, so you should definitely buy that

1259
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:46,860
Ring 'chirin chirin'

1260
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:49,960
Call customers quickly and serve them right away

1261
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:50,400
Then

1262
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,260
You'll probably get around

1263
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:54,260
50 yen on Day 1

1264
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:57,500
Buying the phone first is a definite must

1265
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,460
Yeah, thanks Sui-chan

1266
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,360
This upgraded desk

1267
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:04,560
If I want to buy it next

1268
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:05,780
Probably

1269
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:07,480
If you miss it here

1270
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:08,660
It won't appear again

1271
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:11,740
So put it in this filing cabinet

1272
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:14,940
You can keep it saved, right? Yeah

1273
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:18,480
You can carry it over to the next day

1274
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:22,000
So you can take it out the next day and buy it

1275
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:25,380
I think it's good to keep that in mind

1276
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:26,040
Also

1277
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:31,180
Since we didn't reduce chairs earlier

1278
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:33,820
Customers were getting all mixed up

1279
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:35,560
But you can actually remove chairs

1280
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:35,720
This one

1281
00:48:37,110 --> 00:48:38,230
Just tap-tap it

1282
00:48:38,970 --> 00:48:39,770
Press X or something

1283
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:41,080
X

1284
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:42,500
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1285
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,020
Wow, really—like this

1286
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:47,000
Right

1287
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:48,500
This thing

1288
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:49,800
For example, near the entrance

1289
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:50,880
There's a lot of customer traffic

1290
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,520
So maybe move the chairs away from there

1291
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:56,620
Right now, this corner seat

1292
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:59,980
Might be a bit hard for customers to access

1293
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:01,060
Because there's a chair in the corner

1294
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,740
The bottom-right one, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1295
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:08,860
So maybe move this one like this?

1296
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:12,860
Thinking about seat arrangements like this

1297
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:15,150
Makes it even more fun

1298
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:17,910
Thank you, Area Manager

1299
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:19,350
Amazing

1300
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:24,470
Please do take this advice into consideration

1301
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:29,130
Anyway, since we don't have that phone yet

1302
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:30,610
I guess we just have to go ahead and do it anyway

1303
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:35,510
OK, OK, maybe it would've been better if we'd gotten a call.

1304
00:49:35,989 --> 00:49:39,430
Will we start taking reservations from day one?

1305
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:43,250
Risu-chan said it's really tough.

1306
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:45,950
Probably, Risu-chan, who's making it, is definitely...

1307
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:46,430
Definitely seems inexperienced.

1308
00:49:46,430 --> 00:49:48,830
Because she's doing it all alone, you know.

1309
00:49:48,830 --> 00:49:49,290
I wonder if it'll be alright.

1310
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:52,110
Then, there's a chance...

1311
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:54,190
Kiara-chan, who's among them,

1312
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:55,130
might help out a bit,

1313
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:55,990
But is that okay?

1314
00:49:55,990 --> 00:49:56,910
If there's a chance it works out,

1315
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:00,280
Like this...

1316
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:07,250
Alright! I'll go ahead and take your order then—yes!

1317
00:50:09,490 --> 00:50:11,830
I can't take the order yet—I got it!

1318
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:15,390
Yes, the order.

1319
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:24,600
Yes.

1320
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:25,760
I’ll just adapt to it.

1321
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,100
It’s starting to feel good.

1322
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:31,060
So fast, so fast!

1323
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:33,020
Efficiency, efficiency!

1324
00:50:41,490 --> 00:50:43,670
It’s only day two, after all.

1325
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:46,230
True, we only have 15 minutes, huh?

1326
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:48,030
I wonder roughly how much we can get done.

1327
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:49,930
This is actually amazing.

1328
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:53,520
Should we ask the coder to listen in?

1329
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,300
Co-

1330
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:03,700
Have the coder listen in...

1331
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,480
That’s pretty great!

1332
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:11,500
Fast, fast—have the coder listen!

1333
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:17,330
Here you go.

1334
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:23,080
Whoa, awesome!

1335
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:24,320
Clear!

1336
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:24,800
Clear!

1337
00:51:26,490 --> 00:51:27,750
We did it!

1338
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:32,930
I see.

1339
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:34,210
Well then...

1340
00:51:34,210 --> 00:51:36,710
We have 75 yen. What can we buy with that?

1341
00:51:40,090 --> 00:51:43,310
I wonder if that thing will appear. What will show up?

1342
00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:45,650
Will this become usable?

1343
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:51,240
Yeah, we can buy that Multi-Pla.

1344
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:54,200
Sink, yeah.

1345
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,000
And then, put it beside...

1346
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,080
Put the sink inside.

1347
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:01,230
Inside the document shelf.

1348
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:06,710
Put this green one inside here.

1349
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:07,550
Yeah, exactly.

1350
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:10,250
Like this...

1351
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:12,310
Like this, maybe?

1352
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:14,070
But...

1353
00:52:14,070 --> 00:52:16,730
The 'Plus' is showing up, right?

1354
00:52:16,730 --> 00:52:21,810
When 'Plus' appears and it starts, you can...

1355
00:52:24,270 --> 00:52:25,630
Hit it repeatedly...

1356
00:52:25,630 --> 00:52:28,710
to raise the gauge, right?

1357
00:52:28,830 --> 00:52:30,390
Although you can't do it until it actually starts.

1358
00:52:31,450 --> 00:52:34,370
I think we could buy other things too, if there's anything else we want.

1359
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:36,720
This 'Multi Brush' thing is actually quite recommended.

1360
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,050
Multi Brush.

1361
00:52:38,050 --> 00:52:38,550
This one?

1362
00:52:38,970 --> 00:52:40,330
Yeah, this one costs 20 yen.

1363
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:42,450
It says dishwashing speed becomes three times faster.

1364
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:43,250
That’s seriously awesome!

1365
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:45,690
If you have this,

1366
00:52:45,690 --> 00:52:49,480
floor-cleaning speed also becomes super fast,

1367
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:52,610
so it's recommended the dishwashing person keeps hold of it.

1368
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:54,390
Outside, maybe?

1369
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:58,570
Apparently it's best for the dishwashing person to keep it.

1370
00:52:58,570 --> 00:53:00,650
Or maybe inside is fine too?

1371
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:01,570
Would Kiara be okay with it?

1372
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:02,370
OK.

1373
00:53:03,070 --> 00:53:04,550
Also, about Kiara—I see.

1374
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:07,210
Kiara should, right at the start when it begins,

1375
00:53:07,210 --> 00:53:09,050
upgrade this first...

1376
00:53:09,050 --> 00:53:09,350
Desk.

1377
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:10,970
It might be better to tap it rapidly.

1378
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:13,090
Right here—the digital one, yeah.

1379
00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:15,010
OK, OK, OK, good.

1380
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:16,880
I’ll take it.

1381
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:18,780
By the way, Kiara...

1382
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:20,280
This document shelf...

1383
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,980
can we rotate it to face forward?

1384
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:26,090
Isn't it facing forward right now?

1385
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:28,990
In this state,

1386
00:53:28,990 --> 00:53:30,370
it's hard to tell what it evolved into.

1387
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:33,510
Let's spin it once more.

1388
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:36,530
The green one...

1389
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:39,670
Yeah, the green one—the green one! Like this...

1390
00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:42,010
Then you'll see what it evolves into, right?

1391
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:44,790
Kind of, yeah.

1392
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:50,190
Shall we try it like this?

1393
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:52,770
If there's any part that's hard to use...

1394
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:55,630
Maybe we should rearrange the layout.

1395
00:53:56,970 --> 00:54:00,810
The other side was totally fine, though.

1396
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:04,230
Alright, let's give it another go.

1397
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:11,360
Wow, how beautiful! Amazing, fantastic!

1398
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:12,960
I wonder what it turned into?

1399
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,700
A dishwasher! It became a dishwasher!

1400
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:15,800
That's wonderful!

1401
00:54:17,459 --> 00:54:20,060
So does that mean we can use it from now on?

1402
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:21,580
Yeah, exactly—it'll change next time.

1403
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:22,000
This...

1404
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:26,330
If we have this multi-brush...

1405
00:54:26,330 --> 00:54:28,230
Can we do anything else with it?

1406
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:29,210
We can, we can!

1407
00:54:31,990 --> 00:54:32,970
Go ahead and try it.

1408
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:34,550
It's super fast, right? So fast!

1409
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:41,350
It's too fast—I'm confused!

1410
00:54:44,589 --> 00:54:46,330
Way too fast—now I'm bored!

1411
00:54:52,930 --> 00:54:55,310
Even when the dishwasher was ready...

1412
00:54:55,310 --> 00:54:57,550
Do we still need to use the mayo brush?

1413
00:54:58,030 --> 00:54:59,070
The dishwasher...

1414
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:01,270
automatically washes the dishes, you know.

1415
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:04,010
Hmm...

1416
00:55:05,090 --> 00:55:06,870
Well, maybe just try using it once...

1417
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:09,410
It might be better to see for yourself how it works.

1418
00:55:09,410 --> 00:55:10,470
I think so too.

1419
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:15,070
But honestly, washing them yourself is still faster.

1420
00:55:15,070 --> 00:55:17,410
So, if we're thinking about speedrunning (RTA)...

1421
00:55:17,989 --> 00:55:20,130
If you have that multi-brush...

1422
00:55:20,130 --> 00:55:23,930
Buy a slightly bigger sink...

1423
00:55:23,930 --> 00:55:25,610
And wash everything all at once there.

1424
00:55:25,610 --> 00:55:29,070
That’s probably the most efficient way, I think.

1425
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:32,089
Oh no—it froze!

1426
00:55:32,089 --> 00:55:32,450
Something...

1427
00:55:32,450 --> 00:55:33,790
Feels laggy, doesn't it? Like it's puffing up.

1428
00:55:33,790 --> 00:55:34,209
Are you okay?

1429
00:55:34,209 --> 00:55:37,430
It was lagging for a bit, but it's fine now.

1430
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:41,940
Okay, I see.

1431
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:44,180
Alright, we'll buy the dishwasher but won't actually use it.

1432
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:49,150
We can evolve the job diary again, right?

1433
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:50,900
Then it’ll become a different sink again.

1434
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:51,000
This...

1435
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:51,800
It's random, right?

1436
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:54,100
Is it random evolution?

1437
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:54,669
Yes.

1438
00:55:54,669 --> 00:55:58,020
I think there are three possible evolutions for sinks.

1439
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,730
There are three types?!

1440
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:01,060
Wow!

1441
00:56:04,850 --> 00:56:05,930
Or maybe even four?

1442
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:13,080
Well, if that's provided, then that's the end of it.

1443
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:20,230
Here you go!

1444
00:56:21,350 --> 00:56:22,850
Ah, so fast, so fast!

1445
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:24,170
Nice, nice!

1446
00:56:24,170 --> 00:56:25,590
It ended before I even noticed!

1447
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:27,340
Clap clap, clap!

1448
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:28,020
Clap clap!

1449
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:29,280
This...

1450
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:33,040
How many days' worth can we earn within 15 minutes?

1451
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:33,840
Yeah, yeah.

1452
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:35,620
Ah...

1453
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:39,600
What should we do with the right side here?

1454
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:42,800
Well, this one...

1455
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,640
I'll leave it up to you.

1456
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:46,780
It's only once per day anyway.

1457
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:51,000
The left side gets more complicated with burgers, right?

1458
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:51,480
Yeah, that's true.

1459
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:52,420
More varieties get added.

1460
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,040
We don't need that. I see.

1461
00:57:01,130 --> 00:57:03,570
There's a plate here.

1462
00:57:03,570 --> 00:57:05,730
What should we do?

1463
00:57:06,010 --> 00:57:12,250
I think it's better to buy it around now.

1464
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:12,950
I see.

1465
00:57:13,610 --> 00:57:15,370
From here on, customers will increase dramatically...

1466
00:57:15,370 --> 00:57:18,450
And you'll start falling behind, you know.

1467
00:57:18,450 --> 00:57:19,570
Because of the number of plates.

1468
00:57:20,350 --> 00:57:20,990
Ah, I get it.

1469
00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:23,650
If three seats get filled by customers at once...

1470
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:25,769
Right now, we only have four plates...

1471
00:57:25,830 --> 00:57:28,750
So if six people show up, we'll definitely run out of plates—that makes sense.

1472
00:57:29,470 --> 00:57:32,470
I kind of feel like maybe I should just go ahead and buy it.

1473
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:33,980
I bought it.

1474
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:34,960
Hmm?

1475
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,820
So, are we ultimately not buying a dishwasher?

1476
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,740
I'll leave it up to everyone—whether to buy one or

1477
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:43,620
do something else instead. Where's this

1478
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:46,180
this? Ah, I don't have any money.

1479
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:51,100
But I can still manage fine with hand-washing for now.

1480
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:52,280
Then, this

1481
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:54,320
should probably stay hidden for now.

1482
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:58,210
Isn't the dish placement too far away?

1483
00:57:58,210 --> 00:57:58,780
What about Carela?

1484
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:01,490
I wonder what they'd think.

1485
00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:11,870
Well, I’ll always be passing through here anyway.

1486
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:14,099
This is totally in the way.

1487
00:58:14,099 --> 00:58:14,670
In the way.

1488
00:58:15,070 --> 00:58:16,270
No, no, it's fine.

1489
00:58:16,590 --> 00:58:17,330
Okay.

1490
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:19,220
Looks good.

1491
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:21,180
Looks good. Everything's ready, so

1492
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:23,879
next, let's replace the dishwasher. Okay.

1493
00:58:23,879 --> 00:58:27,760
Feels like it's running nicely.

1494
00:58:27,979 --> 00:58:29,940
Probably won't do the 'peshi-peshi' thing.

1495
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:30,640
If you try it,

1496
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:31,620
go ahead, give it a try!

1497
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:33,260
I wonder what it'll turn into.

1498
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:35,960
It'll be a Big Sink.

1499
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:36,500
I'll leave it to your order.

1500
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:39,100
Ah, not a Big Sink after all.

1501
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:41,120
Maybe it is a Big Sink.

1502
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:42,920
Big Sink or Power Sink, I wonder?

1503
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:53,140
A brush, right?

1504
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:53,480
Brush.

1505
00:58:54,450 --> 00:58:54,810
Ah.

1506
00:58:55,110 --> 00:58:55,590
You said so yourself.

1507
00:59:00,030 --> 00:59:00,730
Luxury.

1508
00:59:08,330 --> 00:59:09,810
The order's coming in.

1509
00:59:12,830 --> 00:59:13,550
Again today,

1510
00:59:14,470 --> 00:59:15,190
dishes.

1511
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:18,480
By the way,

1512
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:27,440
if you fail five times within that 155-minute window and get a game over,

1513
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:31,359
can you restart from the beginning again?

1514
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:32,300
I think you'd have to start over from the very beginning.

1515
00:59:34,299 --> 00:59:35,780
At that point,

1516
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:38,920
do they at least give you credit for the highest day count you reached?

1517
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:42,380
What happened last time?

1518
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:43,760
I don't think they gave it to us last time.

1519
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:45,900
Seriously? Then failing would really suck.

1520
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:48,380
That means we absolutely must avoid failing, seriously.

1521
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:49,280
Oh, thank you very much.

1522
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:50,520
Maybe.

1523
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:52,580
I've kind of forgotten the rules around here,

1524
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:53,580
not sure exactly how it worked.

1525
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:56,940
Alrighty!

1526
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:59,300
If you get a game over,

1527
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:01,180
that's it—yep, it's over. Done.

1528
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:04,940
End of story. Scary.

1529
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:06,880
Okay, good!

1530
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:12,200
Alright, okay!

1531
01:00:15,650 --> 01:00:16,050
OK.

1532
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:21,380
Ah, sorry.

1533
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:24,380
This actually seems pretty great.

1534
01:00:26,010 --> 01:00:28,750
Can we make the window side wider?

1535
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:30,870
With this layout, probably not.

1536
01:00:31,830 --> 01:00:32,650
Where's the window?

1537
01:00:33,290 --> 01:00:35,650
Um, that pass-through area here.

1538
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,980
Ah, that wall there

1539
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:41,240
can't be demolished, right? I see.

1540
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:43,090
Like this,

1541
01:00:44,730 --> 01:00:45,750
Nice!

1542
01:00:46,670 --> 01:00:47,690
Amazing! Amazing! Sorry!

1543
01:00:53,170 --> 01:00:54,110
Now, about the sink,

1544
01:00:54,570 --> 01:00:55,570
What did the sink end up being?

1545
01:00:58,220 --> 01:00:59,800
Soak Sink.

1546
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:01,640
It says 'Soak Sink'.

1547
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:02,180
What's that?

1548
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:04,500
Is this a Soak Sink?

1549
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:05,860
Do we even need it?

1550
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:07,980
Well, maybe it's not bad to have.

1551
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:15,080
The Soak Sink automatically cleans dishes just by placing them inside it.

1552
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:18,860
Before you know it,

1553
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:22,140
though it takes a bit of time.

1554
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:25,079
And since you can only place one dish at a time until it's clean,

1555
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,100
I'm not sure.

1556
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:29,920
I'm not sure.

1557
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:35,320
I think it'd be better to just get an automatic dishwasher.

1558
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:37,340
But how do we undo that?

1559
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:40,080
Because I upgraded this sink to a painted one

1560
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:43,860
Giving that on one hand

1561
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:58,540
Because I upgraded this sink

1562
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:00,940
After updating it

1563
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:03,840
We'll end up back in Shokuzenki

1564
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:06,900
We won't go back to Shokuzenki

1565
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:10,560
There are two more types, and after that

1566
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,220
Either one of the two Power Sinks?

1567
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:15,540
It should become either a Big Sink or a Power Sink

1568
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:21,340
Should I try upgrading again via gacha?

1569
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:23,340
Might be worth a shot

1570
01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:28,250
Also, as long as Cookie Lis-chan isn't

1571
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:29,230
Still finding it too difficult

1572
01:02:29,230 --> 01:02:31,910
Maybe I could add a few more tables

1573
01:02:31,910 --> 01:02:34,850
Pekora is handling the dining tables

1574
01:02:34,969 --> 01:02:37,130
I wonder if customers will start coming in

1575
01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:37,930
It feels a bit sparse

1576
01:02:37,930 --> 01:02:40,950
Actually, maybe not all tables were being used

1577
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:42,680
We don't really need that many

1578
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:44,340
If only we could just call

1579
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:48,560
There's no phone to instantly fill up the place with customers

1580
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:50,200
Well then, alright

1581
01:02:52,470 --> 01:02:54,430
Let's clear this once first

1582
01:02:54,430 --> 01:02:56,350
Then I'd like to try the version with the phone

1583
01:02:56,350 --> 01:02:58,630
Yeah, that's true—ah, peshi peshi

1584
01:02:59,130 --> 01:03:00,350
Peshi peshi peshi peshi peshi

1585
01:03:00,970 --> 01:03:05,030
I wonder what we'll get, I wonder what we'll get, tarara

1586
01:03:05,930 --> 01:03:06,670
Isn't that the one?

1587
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:08,450
Could it be a Power Sink?

1588
01:03:11,510 --> 01:03:13,750
This was a good one, right?

1589
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:16,450
I think the Power Sink is good too

1590
01:03:16,450 --> 01:03:20,510
Feels suited for RTM though—well, okay

1591
01:03:22,470 --> 01:03:23,510
Let's go right away

1592
01:03:24,590 --> 01:03:25,690
Let's buy it!

1593
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:28,580
I'm gonna buy it!

1594
01:03:30,820 --> 01:03:33,000
More customers, please come

1595
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:38,780
You can come even more, you know!

1596
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:39,570
O-oh

1597
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:39,880
Oh

1598
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:43,560
Yosho—

1599
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:57,420
Nice! Okay, good

1600
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:02,040
Just need to get the plates

1601
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:07,810
Here you go—I'll take your order!

1602
01:04:10,550 --> 01:04:11,350
Feeling good

1603
01:04:12,230 --> 01:04:13,000
Okay

1604
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,830
Taking orders now!

1605
01:04:17,170 --> 01:04:19,470
Even without taking orders

1606
01:04:19,470 --> 01:04:20,790
It's definitely a burger

1607
01:04:21,970 --> 01:04:23,090
Oops

1608
01:04:23,090 --> 01:04:23,660
I want that

1609
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:27,030
Alright

1610
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:28,190
Careful

1611
01:04:28,970 --> 01:04:38,390
Customer

1612
01:04:40,570 --> 01:04:45,550
The number of customers is increasing

1613
01:04:46,630 --> 01:04:48,990
Indeed

1614
01:04:48,990 --> 01:04:51,330
Feels like it's getting busier

1615
01:04:57,950 --> 01:04:59,050
Thank you

1616
01:05:01,590 --> 01:05:02,990
Probably the last group

1617
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:14,830
Cleaning

1618
01:05:22,270 --> 01:05:23,490
Please give me a tip

1619
01:05:27,860 --> 01:05:28,679
Earned money!

1620
01:05:31,790 --> 01:05:33,030
It's getting busier

1621
01:05:34,310 --> 01:05:35,830
Rich people—

1622
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:37,710
Ah

1623
01:05:37,710 --> 01:05:39,010
Hmm

1624
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:40,640
Hmm

1625
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:42,130
Well, either way is fine, I guess

1626
01:05:42,130 --> 01:05:43,080
If it were RTA

1627
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:44,460
Would it not matter?

1628
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:45,220
This one doesn't really matter either way

1629
01:05:45,220 --> 01:05:45,720
Yeah

1630
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:47,280
Yes

1631
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:47,640
Then

1632
01:05:49,530 --> 01:05:53,850
I'll buy this Power Sink! Yes!

1633
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:55,280
Gambling

1634
01:05:56,770 --> 01:05:58,550
It's kinda expensive

1635
01:05:58,550 --> 01:06:00,170
Ah, but I guess we can afford it

1636
01:06:01,089 --> 01:06:02,190
Can we buy it here?

1637
01:06:02,490 --> 01:06:04,890
Buying it here

1638
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:07,300
What exactly is a Power Sink again?

1639
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:07,600
What was it again?

1640
01:06:08,780 --> 01:06:10,360
The Power Sink

1641
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:12,919
Is the thing that makes dishwashing faster

1642
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:17,380
If I use it with the brush

1643
01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:18,920
It probably finishes in a 'pew!'

1644
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:21,640
That fast?

1645
01:06:26,030 --> 01:06:27,810
There are two sinks now.

1646
01:06:27,810 --> 01:06:33,570
All these different chandeliers hanging down...

1647
01:06:33,570 --> 01:06:35,130
Do you understand the effect of this?

1648
01:06:35,810 --> 01:06:37,990
It says it gives a luxurious feel.

1649
01:06:39,140 --> 01:06:39,680
That's right.

1650
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:41,840
I think we picked something just now, between two options.

1651
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:44,460
Which one to choose—this one here?

1652
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:46,600
If we pick this one...

1653
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:49,920
We can choose a buff effect, right?

1654
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:50,920
There are three of them.

1655
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:52,500
And now...

1656
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:54,940
I'm not exactly sure what we just did.

1657
01:06:54,940 --> 01:06:56,200
Maybe it gives a slightly more luxurious vibe?

1658
01:06:57,700 --> 01:07:01,100
And now, diamonds...

1659
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:02,260
Sometimes there's one diamond...

1660
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:03,380
Sometimes three...

1661
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:05,600
There are versions with diamonds attached.

1662
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:07,300
These diamonds...

1663
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:09,800
When three are attached, you get one buff...

1664
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:11,180
That's how it works.

1665
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:13,400
Yeah, there was one with three diamonds, right?

1666
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,300
I can't afford to buy this sculpture.

1667
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:16,820
It's too expensive—I can't buy it.

1668
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,100
Not even that globe...

1669
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:23,820
Or even one painting—I can't afford either.

1670
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:26,360
But, you know...

1671
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:28,260
In an RTA run, I don't think...

1672
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:30,880
We really need to prioritize this stuff.

1673
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:32,520
By the way...

1674
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:32,820
This...

1675
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:34,780
Floors and walls are free, so, well...

1676
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:35,780
You can buy as much as you want.

1677
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:39,260
Oh, really? Just hold X and...

1678
01:07:39,260 --> 01:07:39,840
You can buy them.

1679
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:46,040
But I don't need them—I won't buy any.

1680
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:49,280
It's just personal preference anyway.

1681
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:51,320
So, this time...

1682
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:53,400
Should we go with buying nothing at all?

1683
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:55,200
Yeah, that sounds fine.

1684
01:07:57,950 --> 01:07:58,310
This...

1685
01:07:59,210 --> 01:08:02,150
Can these decorations be upgraded too?

1686
01:08:02,990 --> 01:08:04,470
No, these can't be upgraded.

1687
01:08:04,470 --> 01:08:06,450
Apparently, you can't do that.

1688
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:11,660
OK! Let's go, let's go! Let's go!

1689
01:08:13,030 --> 01:08:14,610
Let's do our best again today.

1690
01:08:14,610 --> 01:08:15,930
Let's do our best! Let's do our best! Let's do our best!

1691
01:08:15,930 --> 01:08:18,850
Welcome! Welcome!

1692
01:08:20,529 --> 01:08:23,170
Two Ivys, right? Yes, okay!

1693
01:08:35,810 --> 01:08:38,189
And then cross the sky.

1694
01:08:40,069 --> 01:08:41,550
How's the Power Sink?

1695
01:08:41,630 --> 01:08:42,529
Whoa, so fast!

1696
01:08:42,670 --> 01:08:43,330
Right?!

1697
01:08:44,890 --> 01:08:46,330
Power Sink is awesome!

1698
01:08:46,609 --> 01:08:47,529
The best!

1699
01:08:47,990 --> 01:08:48,649
Hair—

1700
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:51,720
Arai's hair has arrived!

1701
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:01,060
No matter what happens, I won't be discouraged.

1702
01:09:01,060 --> 01:09:02,760
No matter what happens, I won't be discouraged.

1703
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:10,670
Badge...

1704
01:09:13,370 --> 01:09:13,769
Come on!

1705
01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:22,010
Ufufufu~

1706
01:09:28,029 --> 01:09:28,859
Oh no!

1707
01:09:28,859 --> 01:09:32,770
The shop is getting dirty... Plates without stains~

1708
01:09:34,229 --> 01:09:34,609
Ah!

1709
01:09:35,649 --> 01:09:36,029
Thank you very much!

1710
01:09:41,979 --> 01:09:42,549
Oh no!

1711
01:09:42,549 --> 01:09:43,640
The shop is getting dirty.

1712
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:46,130
Sorry about that.

1713
01:09:46,130 --> 01:09:46,740
As for the character, that...

1714
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:49,520
Can't be supported. Can't go outside.

1715
01:09:52,670 --> 01:09:53,569
It's too far away.

1716
01:09:56,050 --> 01:09:58,050
I don't need the normal evolution though...

1717
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:02,200
So I guess it's better to evolve it after all.

1718
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:04,360
Yeah, that's right.

1719
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:08,580
If you get a Power Evolution on your first try, that's a win.

1720
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:12,480
But that's just down to luck, huh?

1721
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:15,480
From this side...

1722
01:10:32,310 --> 01:10:33,830
Super fast!

1723
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:38,580
The fastest in the world—super fast!

1724
01:10:41,170 --> 01:10:43,470
It's like Germany's Autobahn!

1725
01:10:43,980 --> 01:10:45,540
Is it really that fast?

1726
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:47,580
There's no speed limit or anything.

1727
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:49,360
No speed limit.

1728
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:50,920
So, there really isn't any limit?

1729
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:51,700
That sounds dangerous.

1730
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:54,500
That's probably why it's so popular.

1731
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:58,660
There are actually quite a few people who want to drive in Germany.

1732
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:01,160
That's fine, isn't it?

1733
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:04,060
Two wonderful things.

1734
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:07,920
I know it really well.

1735
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:09,880
The viewers are getting upset.

1736
01:11:12,970 --> 01:11:16,650
The customers' patience meter is disappearing.

1737
01:11:17,470 --> 01:11:19,350
I think that's better.

1738
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:21,640
Maybe it's better not to look.

1739
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:25,720
Even if it disappears, isn't it not really causing any issues anymore?

1740
01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:29,100
It also feels kind of scary.

1741
01:11:30,259 --> 01:11:31,860
Because of the customers...

1742
01:11:33,820 --> 01:11:35,440
Wait, hold on!

1743
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:38,240
They can't see that it's like this.

1744
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:39,480
This might be bad.

1745
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,220
Well, it'll probably be fine.

1746
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:46,380
Maybe it'll work out.

1747
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:49,800
Hmm, there's also something else I'd like to try.

1748
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:50,910
Maybe we should try evolving it a bit.

1749
01:11:50,910 --> 01:11:53,000
Like evolving the dining table or something.

1750
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,980
Can you really evolve a dining table?

1751
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:56,960
Yes, you can.

1752
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:58,040
This one here...

1753
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:00,220
Anything marked as 'upgradable'...

1754
01:12:00,220 --> 01:12:00,780
...can all be upgraded.

1755
01:12:01,660 --> 01:12:02,720
What does it turn into?

1756
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:03,820
Hey!

1757
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:06,380
There are many different kinds of tables.

1758
01:12:06,380 --> 01:12:07,040
This one too.

1759
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:08,460
OK.

1760
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:08,740
Then...

1761
01:12:08,740 --> 01:12:11,140
Once it starts, I'll upgrade it.

1762
01:12:11,140 --> 01:12:11,680
Please do.

1763
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:13,460
Welcome!

1764
01:12:13,460 --> 01:12:16,960
Elise, we don't need the stove anymore.

1765
01:12:17,450 --> 01:12:19,050
The stove is fine.

1766
01:12:19,370 --> 01:12:21,510
Again, it's fine—OK.

1767
01:12:24,950 --> 01:12:31,130
Leave it to me, please!

1768
01:12:31,429 --> 01:12:34,330
Once every 15 minutes...

1769
01:12:34,330 --> 01:12:36,170
...how much do you want to see?

1770
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:40,330
Huh? What's this? You can't do it? It's the same as washing?

1771
01:12:40,330 --> 01:12:40,930
Washing and...

1772
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:41,810
Huh?

1773
01:12:45,050 --> 01:12:46,270
I can't press anything.

1774
01:12:46,870 --> 01:12:47,430
Huh?

1775
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:47,910
Lag.

1776
01:12:48,590 --> 01:12:49,110
Pressed it.

1777
01:12:49,110 --> 01:12:49,530
Pressed it.

1778
01:12:50,110 --> 01:12:50,830
Huh?

1779
01:12:51,929 --> 01:12:54,890
Lag, lag, lag—maybe...

1780
01:12:56,420 --> 01:12:57,940
Can't press rate.

1781
01:13:00,220 --> 01:13:03,490
I might need some plates.

1782
01:13:04,550 --> 01:13:05,210
Hold on a sec.

1783
01:13:06,270 --> 01:13:07,290
The response is...

1784
01:13:08,470 --> 01:13:10,110
It got laggy.

1785
01:13:10,110 --> 01:13:11,950
It became laggy.

1786
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:13,600
So laggy.

1787
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:14,880
Laggy—no way!

1788
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:16,340
Pose.

1789
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:19,680
Pose showing it's okay now.

1790
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:22,160
OK.

1791
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:24,920
OK.

1792
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:28,420
One keyboard.

1793
01:13:28,420 --> 01:13:30,940
The misaligned button—that's what happened.

1794
01:13:33,020 --> 01:13:34,360
Kyura-san.

1795
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:37,070
Excuse me, sorry about that.

1796
01:13:37,070 --> 01:13:41,579
Naked—full nudity assimilation! Full nudity assimilation!

1797
01:13:41,579 --> 01:13:43,080
Nobody's asking for that!

1798
01:13:43,580 --> 01:13:44,100
Huh?

1799
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:47,020
People are asking for it—the chat wants it!

1800
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:48,860
Hiara-chan.

1801
01:13:48,860 --> 01:13:50,720
The listeners might want it.

1802
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,880
We need to clear these plates first.

1803
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:55,520
Wake up the customers outside.

1804
01:13:56,940 --> 01:13:58,540
That cloud gauge, you know...

1805
01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:02,470
I want to wake up.

1806
01:14:05,980 --> 01:14:06,820
Try putting it down.

1807
01:14:09,660 --> 01:14:11,860
Oh no, it's getting busy—really busy!

1808
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:12,600
Gotta take all the orders.

1809
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:14,260
It's super busy!

1810
01:14:15,409 --> 01:14:17,810
Sorry, but the shop being messy is something you’ll have to forgive.

1811
01:14:17,810 --> 01:14:19,250
A bit of messiness actually makes it tastier—that's the basic rule.

1812
01:14:19,250 --> 01:14:19,810
With restaurants...

1813
01:14:20,210 --> 01:14:21,230
Anyway, I'm counting on you.

1814
01:14:21,230 --> 01:14:23,070
Deliciousness doesn't correlate with cleanliness.

1815
01:14:23,070 --> 01:14:23,770
Yeah, exactly, exactly!

1816
01:14:23,770 --> 01:14:25,710
Oh no, I missed an order!

1817
01:14:25,710 --> 01:14:27,290
Oh no, oh no, oh no—nice!

1818
01:14:27,290 --> 01:14:28,650
Nice! That was close!

1819
01:14:30,140 --> 01:14:31,560
Only dirt stays silent forever.

1820
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:33,260
We need to clear that plate.

1821
01:14:34,310 --> 01:14:35,590
Nice, nice!

1822
01:14:35,590 --> 01:14:35,830
Nice!

1823
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:38,440
Probably just one plate.

1824
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:39,900
There's an extra one downstairs.

1825
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:41,260
Clear the one downstairs.

1826
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:48,490
Outside customers won't wait.

1827
01:14:48,490 --> 01:14:49,450
When they say they can't wait,

1828
01:14:49,450 --> 01:14:50,790
the gauge turns red, you know.

1829
01:14:51,550 --> 01:14:52,190
I see.

1830
01:14:53,610 --> 01:14:54,250
You know,

1831
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:56,760
Outside customers won't wait.

1832
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:58,100
When it says they can't wait,

1833
01:14:58,100 --> 01:15:05,340
maybe we should prioritize serving burgers to solo customers first.

1834
01:15:05,780 --> 01:15:07,880
There's only one plate left to clear anyway.

1835
01:15:08,820 --> 01:15:09,140
I get it.

1836
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:13,520
Knowing this,

1837
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:16,420
But I think we can go now.

1838
01:15:16,420 --> 01:15:16,739
Clear!

1839
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:18,240
That was close, that was close!

1840
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:20,560
It was really tight at the start.

1841
01:15:23,150 --> 01:15:24,990
So, about this—does this mean

1842
01:15:24,990 --> 01:15:28,590
we don't have to clean the dirty store anymore?

1843
01:15:30,930 --> 01:15:31,650
No, that's not right.

1844
01:15:32,860 --> 01:15:33,800
You know, earlier,

1845
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:35,399
with that buff effect,

1846
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:39,820
there's also a buff effect that prevents the store from getting dirty.

1847
01:15:39,820 --> 01:15:40,920
Oh, really?

1848
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:43,830
Should we aim for that?

1849
01:15:43,830 --> 01:15:48,060
We’d probably be in trouble if we don’t clean.

1850
01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:48,380
But,

1851
01:15:49,660 --> 01:15:51,060
it’s super dirty.

1852
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:56,370
There’s also an item that instantly cleans things up,

1853
01:15:56,370 --> 01:15:57,440
called a mop.

1854
01:15:57,780 --> 01:15:59,780
Oh, there’s something like that too.

1855
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:01,960
That’s also based on luck,

1856
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:02,900
whether it drops or not.

1857
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:04,960
I wish we could get a mop.

1858
01:16:05,780 --> 01:16:06,440
Well then,

1859
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:07,020
it might drop.

1860
01:16:08,950 --> 01:16:11,310
This Gas Rinnit thing,

1861
01:16:11,310 --> 01:16:13,310
looks pretty good,

1862
01:16:13,310 --> 01:16:15,250
doesn’t it look like Gasuri?

1863
01:16:16,850 --> 01:16:17,810
Eh, but

1864
01:16:17,810 --> 01:16:20,510
we don’t need it, right? We don’t need it.

1865
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:23,260
Huh? Don’t need it? What did it turn into?

1866
01:16:23,260 --> 01:16:25,080
That dining table,

1867
01:16:27,620 --> 01:16:29,640
is a shared table.

1868
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:31,580
We only need one of these, right?

1869
01:16:31,580 --> 01:16:32,940
Even if two people come,

1870
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:36,840
it’s just about thinking time,

1871
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:39,740
like at the very beginning, when they’re deciding

1872
01:16:39,740 --> 01:16:43,299
what to eat—that decision takes way too long.

1873
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:47,880
I wonder how this would work in an RTA run.

1874
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:50,040
Maybe it’s worth buying and trying it out once.

1875
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:51,780
Yeah, let’s buy it.

1876
01:16:51,780 --> 01:16:54,690
We’ve got money anyway.

1877
01:16:54,690 --> 01:16:55,330
Might be a good idea.

1878
01:16:57,010 --> 01:16:57,890
Also,

1879
01:16:57,890 --> 01:16:59,730
earlier, about plates,

1880
01:16:59,730 --> 01:17:03,350
Suu mentioned plates,

1881
01:17:04,330 --> 01:17:05,010
actually,

1882
01:17:05,010 --> 01:17:06,910
you can pick them up diagonally.

1883
01:17:06,910 --> 01:17:07,290
Then,

1884
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:08,670
we should just use Suu-ga.

1885
01:17:09,110 --> 01:17:10,470
Yeah, yeah, you can pick them up, you can pick them up.

1886
01:17:11,670 --> 01:17:13,370
Understood for worst-case scenarios.

1887
01:17:13,370 --> 01:17:14,750
Yeah, in worst-case scenarios,

1888
01:17:14,970 --> 01:17:17,190
even with walls, you can grab diagonally.

1889
01:17:17,190 --> 01:17:18,990
Ah, so even from farther away—I get it.

1890
01:17:19,570 --> 01:17:19,910
Huh?

1891
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:24,720
I accidentally recorded some of our conversation.

1892
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:25,380
Thanks.

1893
01:17:26,630 --> 01:17:27,430
Heave ho, heave ho.

1894
01:17:27,430 --> 01:17:28,450
Where should I put this?

1895
01:17:28,450 --> 01:17:29,750
It’ll end up far away.

1896
01:17:30,269 --> 01:17:32,250
Press B to pass through walls,

1897
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:32,990
you know.

1898
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:37,560
But let’s see,

1899
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:39,480
within these 15 minutes,

1900
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:40,820
how far we can get with our current skill.

1901
01:17:40,820 --> 01:17:42,920
Honestly, yeah.

1902
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:45,900
Luck with gacha pulls probably matters too.

1903
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:49,720
It’s really about whether we can reach Day Hatch or not.

1904
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:51,200
With just 15 minutes...

1905
01:17:51,739 --> 01:17:53,120
If we have 15 minutes,

1906
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:55,960
I guess we could probably make it around here.

1907
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:57,520
That's what I think.

1908
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:59,180
Personally, I’d say we’ve got plenty of time.

1909
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:04,710
So, should we reset once?

1910
01:18:06,030 --> 01:18:08,090
Or should we just keep going with the hard one?

1911
01:18:08,870 --> 01:18:09,370
Just for a moment...

1912
01:18:09,370 --> 01:18:11,310
I also want to try that phone thing.

1913
01:18:11,310 --> 01:18:12,270
Honestly, Pekora...

1914
01:18:12,870 --> 01:18:13,810
Reservation...

1915
01:18:14,610 --> 01:18:15,710
Let’s do the reservation.

1916
01:18:16,590 --> 01:18:18,790
Could you reset it once for me?

1917
01:18:19,450 --> 01:18:20,470
Oh, and by the way—

1918
01:18:20,470 --> 01:18:22,790
There’s that catalog re-order option, right?

1919
01:18:22,790 --> 01:18:23,270
Down below...

1920
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:24,650
This one exists.

1921
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:27,660
You can do this for just 10 yen.

1922
01:18:27,660 --> 01:18:28,780
Give it a try.

1923
01:18:28,850 --> 01:18:30,490
What even is a catalog?

1924
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:35,940
It’s useful when none of the items you want show up.

1925
01:18:35,940 --> 01:18:36,620
Yeah, exactly, exactly!

1926
01:18:37,540 --> 01:18:39,140
For example, like this—

1927
01:18:39,140 --> 01:18:40,940
You want a mop, but it doesn’t appear,

1928
01:18:41,949 --> 01:18:43,010
Like, um...

1929
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:44,330
when something you really want just won’t show up,

1930
01:18:44,330 --> 01:18:45,590
as a last resort,

1931
01:18:45,590 --> 01:18:47,250
you spend 10 yen using this feature.

1932
01:18:47,250 --> 01:18:48,450
The gacha’s pretty nice.

1933
01:18:48,450 --> 01:18:50,910
Each time you use it, it adds 10 yen.

1934
01:18:50,910 --> 01:18:52,670
Seriously? It’s already 20 yen!

1935
01:18:52,970 --> 01:18:56,170
My recommendation is this plate stand.

1936
01:18:56,170 --> 01:18:58,590
The plate stand is actually quite good.

1937
01:18:58,590 --> 01:19:00,659
It holds four used plates.

1938
01:19:00,659 --> 01:19:03,590
You can put four dirty plates there—it’s super handy.

1939
01:19:05,170 --> 01:19:06,230
I really want it.

1940
01:19:08,180 --> 01:19:09,280
As for cleaning-related items...

1941
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:13,580
I guess having somewhere to put dirty plates would help avoid situations where you can’t place them anywhere.

1942
01:19:14,070 --> 01:19:14,770
But...

1943
01:19:14,770 --> 01:19:15,830
When I was watching earlier,

1944
01:19:15,830 --> 01:19:18,130
there wasn’t really a spot for dirty plates,

1945
01:19:18,130 --> 01:19:18,610
so...

1946
01:19:18,610 --> 01:19:20,570
I didn’t really feel troubled by that much.

1947
01:19:21,510 --> 01:19:23,310
So maybe it doesn’t really matter either way.

1948
01:19:24,990 --> 01:19:25,390
Well then...

1949
01:19:25,390 --> 01:19:26,930
The absolute must-haves are definitely

1950
01:19:27,390 --> 01:19:29,790
the brush and Power Sink.

1951
01:19:31,050 --> 01:19:31,730
Yeah, that’s right.

1952
01:19:32,270 --> 01:19:34,070
Brush and Power Sink.

1953
01:19:34,070 --> 01:19:36,950
Speed Boots aren’t necessary.

1954
01:19:38,730 --> 01:19:39,770
What about that one above...

1955
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:41,430
What’s on the top left?

1956
01:19:42,050 --> 01:19:43,170
Oh, takeout!

1957
01:19:44,810 --> 01:19:46,910
Also, if you put that on the table,

1958
01:19:46,910 --> 01:19:48,790
customers finish eating really quickly,

1959
01:19:48,790 --> 01:19:51,210
so they leave sooner.

1960
01:19:51,210 --> 01:19:53,990
It improves your table turnover rate.

1961
01:19:53,990 --> 01:19:54,630
However...

1962
01:19:54,630 --> 01:19:55,710
doing that means

1963
01:19:55,710 --> 01:19:58,190
you have to perform the extra task of placing it,

1964
01:19:58,770 --> 01:20:00,710
which the floor staff would have to handle.

1965
01:20:00,710 --> 01:20:01,990
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1966
01:20:02,730 --> 01:20:03,090
Well...

1967
01:20:03,090 --> 01:20:04,470
it depends on whether it actually appears or not.

1968
01:20:05,630 --> 01:20:05,990
And...

1969
01:20:05,990 --> 01:20:07,190
there are all kinds of items,

1970
01:20:07,190 --> 01:20:09,350
so while speedrunning (RTA), try out different ones

1971
01:20:09,350 --> 01:20:10,750
and see which ones are the most efficient.

1972
01:20:10,750 --> 01:20:12,110
I think that’s worth testing.

1973
01:20:12,630 --> 01:20:13,190
Got it.

1974
01:20:15,350 --> 01:20:16,310
Reset.

1975
01:20:16,310 --> 01:20:17,030
Reset.

1976
01:20:17,570 --> 01:20:18,430
Reset.

1977
01:20:19,130 --> 01:20:20,210
Reset, reset!

1978
01:20:21,990 --> 01:20:23,110
Let’s start over from the beginning.

1979
01:20:23,110 --> 01:20:26,510
Normally, it appears by 8 o’clock.

1980
01:20:28,150 --> 01:20:28,990
Reservation.

1981
01:20:28,990 --> 01:20:29,990
Please also try the desk.

1982
01:20:29,990 --> 01:20:32,610
Going back to the main menu...

1983
01:20:33,740 --> 01:20:34,400
Yeah.

1984
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:36,080
Once...

1985
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:37,140
Let’s start from the beginning again.

1986
01:20:42,150 --> 01:20:42,540
Huh?

1987
01:20:42,540 --> 01:20:43,250
Can’t press video.

1988
01:20:44,250 --> 01:20:46,550
List! Yay, list!

1989
01:20:46,770 --> 01:20:48,030
Yay!

1990
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:50,150
You know, Pekora is red.

1991
01:20:50,990 --> 01:20:51,530
What?

1992
01:20:52,250 --> 01:20:52,760
Um...

1993
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:53,330
The chef's...

1994
01:20:53,790 --> 01:20:54,479
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1995
01:20:54,479 --> 01:20:55,190
Pekora red.

1996
01:20:55,570 --> 01:20:56,370
Ah, I see!

1997
01:20:56,370 --> 01:20:58,610
Why don't they just make it 'Pekora color'?

1998
01:20:58,670 --> 01:20:59,090
That's the one!

1999
01:20:59,090 --> 01:21:00,270
You can change it with mirrors and stuff.

2000
01:21:00,270 --> 01:21:00,790
You can change it right here.

2001
01:21:00,790 --> 01:21:01,730
Huh?

2002
01:21:01,730 --> 01:21:03,630
You can even add ears!

2003
01:21:04,270 --> 01:21:06,770
Wait a sec—don't be silly!

2004
01:21:07,770 --> 01:21:08,490
This color...

2005
01:21:08,790 --> 01:21:11,320
Like, colors and...

2006
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:13,620
Stuff you put on your head and...

2007
01:21:13,620 --> 01:21:16,240
And also, which one exactly is the color?

2008
01:21:16,260 --> 01:21:18,900
Color refers to hats and clothes.

2009
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:20,340
Kind of like that.

2010
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:22,860
When you first pressed it, right?

2011
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:24,800
There is one.

2012
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:27,020
Hmm, there's no bar though.

2013
01:21:27,020 --> 01:21:28,760
There's no gacha either.

2014
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:32,040
Well, there's no bar tomorrow anyway.

2015
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:34,060
If it's not there, then... um...

2016
01:21:34,060 --> 01:21:38,260
The tutorial will handle it...

2017
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:39,720
And then go back...

2018
01:21:41,300 --> 01:21:42,120
Gacha!

2019
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:44,550
What's this called...

2020
01:21:44,550 --> 01:21:46,260
What a pain!

2021
01:21:48,460 --> 01:21:50,600
The menu's in the gacha, okay?

2022
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:53,080
Ah, Pekora-senpai looks more like herself now!

2023
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:56,810
I want to avoid looking too much like Suu-chan though...

2024
01:21:56,810 --> 01:21:58,610
It'd be hard to tell us apart otherwise.

2025
01:21:58,610 --> 01:22:00,520
If we have bunny ears...

2026
01:22:02,740 --> 01:22:04,600
And slightly different colors too...

2027
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:08,260
Yeah, oh wow, that actually looks good! It's coming together!

2028
01:22:08,260 --> 01:22:10,440
Here it comes! Perfect color, okay!

2029
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:12,400
We gotta do this first, though.

2030
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:15,560
We don't need a tutorial.

2031
01:22:18,450 --> 01:22:20,070
She's dancing, so it's fine.

2032
01:22:20,950 --> 01:22:21,390
OK!

2033
01:22:22,740 --> 01:22:24,780
Please, burger, come out! Burger, come out!

2034
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:25,840
Thank you!

2035
01:22:29,710 --> 01:22:31,270
Gold first, right?

2036
01:22:31,750 --> 01:22:32,790
Or wait, is it the phone?

2037
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:34,900
Yeah, buy the phone.

2038
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:37,840
C--U-D-D-L-E, right?

2039
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:42,820
It's getting a bit easier.

2040
01:22:44,230 --> 01:22:45,290
It's starting to get fun!

2041
01:22:45,290 --> 01:22:46,630
It's getting kind of rural though...

2042
01:22:46,630 --> 01:22:47,290
Is that okay?

2043
01:22:47,290 --> 01:22:48,450
Ah, but this place is supposed to be city-like!

2044
01:22:50,190 --> 01:22:52,610
Watch out! Watch out! Nice!

2045
01:22:53,830 --> 01:22:55,290
Alright, from here on, it's the start.

2046
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:56,740
Okay.

2047
01:22:56,740 --> 01:22:58,680
Reservation desk, please.

2048
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:00,880
Ah...

2049
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:02,740
So it starts right from here?

2050
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:05,720
Right, this reservation desk...

2051
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:07,700
Where should we put this?

2052
01:23:08,460 --> 01:23:09,200
Ah, here?

2053
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:10,160
Maybe here?

2054
01:23:11,140 --> 01:23:11,460
Inside?

2055
01:23:12,340 --> 01:23:12,660
Yeah.

2056
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:14,530
Ah, I get it.

2057
01:23:14,530 --> 01:23:16,100
But since I'm not using a Kiara controller...

2058
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:17,210
Yeah, I wouldn't know.

2059
01:23:17,210 --> 01:23:18,680
I don't know the buttons—makes sense, right?

2060
01:23:23,020 --> 01:23:25,230
Do you wanna do the bookings or should I?

2061
01:23:25,230 --> 01:23:25,960
But in the beginning...

2062
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:26,940
I think I can do it.

2063
01:23:26,940 --> 01:23:29,630
But later, I don't know who can do it.

2064
01:23:29,630 --> 01:23:33,320
Maybe I can do it because I've been making a lot of burgers.

2065
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:36,540
Ah, no—yeah, okay. So if I have, like...

2066
01:23:36,540 --> 01:23:38,320
free hands... bread...

2067
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:41,600
Mito Mito!

2068
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:45,040
Because this initial prep is included too...

2069
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:46,940
We gotta quickly stack the bread here—bam, bam, bam!

2070
01:23:46,940 --> 01:23:47,540
Right.

2071
01:23:47,540 --> 01:23:49,140
We gotta do it really fast.

2072
01:23:49,140 --> 01:23:50,540
Ah, I see now!

2073
01:23:50,540 --> 01:23:51,880
And, this is pressing B

2074
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:54,400
I think the fastest way is to use the crane and just swing it around like that

2075
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:54,900
Ah—

2076
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:56,820
Not humans, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah

2077
01:23:58,380 --> 01:23:59,260
Alright, let's do it!

2078
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:03,110
Hey, is that spot okay?

2079
01:24:03,110 --> 01:24:03,640
That sink

2080
01:24:05,180 --> 01:24:06,120
Ah— yeah, that's true

2081
01:24:07,370 --> 01:24:11,070
Alright, heave-ho, heave-ho

2082
01:24:14,730 --> 01:24:16,610
Let's give it a try—ring it!

2083
01:24:16,610 --> 01:24:20,950
Ring it! Ah, it’s 3 yen at first

2084
01:24:21,510 --> 01:24:22,810
How many times should we do it?

2085
01:24:22,810 --> 01:24:24,070
At the beginning, you know…

2086
01:24:24,070 --> 01:24:27,130
I think it’s fine to ring them all—every single one

2087
01:24:27,130 --> 01:24:28,770
Is there a limit?

2088
01:24:28,770 --> 01:24:31,610
Even if you keep ringing until the gauge at the top maxes out

2089
01:24:31,610 --> 01:24:33,110
I think it’ll be fine

2090
01:24:34,150 --> 01:24:34,590
It’s fine

2091
01:24:36,270 --> 01:24:37,870
You can ring even more

2092
01:24:37,870 --> 01:24:39,530
You can ring even more

2093
01:24:39,530 --> 01:24:41,770
It’s totally fine—totally fine

2094
01:24:42,550 --> 01:24:44,490
Day One is totally fine

2095
01:24:48,530 --> 01:24:51,050
I think Day One is totally manageable

2096
01:24:56,770 --> 01:24:57,370
But

2097
01:24:57,370 --> 01:24:58,750
Everyone comes all at once

2098
01:24:59,210 --> 01:24:59,950
And yet

2099
01:24:59,950 --> 01:25:02,360
Should we ring all the phones right at the start?

2100
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:03,930
Like, saying 'from the middle' or something

2101
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:07,420
I think ringing them all at once right from the very beginning is best

2102
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:10,280
And with this, all the customers will be

2103
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:11,520
Once these people all leave

2104
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:12,920
That’ll be the end of the day

2105
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:16,540
It’s super fast, crazy fast, right?

2106
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:24,600
We’ve already earned 45 yen!

2107
01:25:25,340 --> 01:25:25,900
Woo!

2108
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:27,480
It’s getting laggy

2109
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:31,780
Sara’s still not done—this is bad

2110
01:25:33,270 --> 01:25:34,510
Laggy Pekora’s fine

2111
01:25:34,930 --> 01:25:35,690
It’s fine

2112
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:41,420
Once we surround that hamburger, it’s over

2113
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:42,880
No way

2114
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:43,700
Nice!

2115
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:49,170
Heave-ho

2116
01:25:51,460 --> 01:25:52,140
Oh—

2117
01:25:52,140 --> 01:25:54,220
Nice! Hurry up

2118
01:25:54,220 --> 01:25:58,960
Buy the upgraded desk

2119
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:00,480
Oh, that exists, exists, exists!

2120
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:01,940
Buy the upgraded desk

2121
01:26:01,940 --> 01:26:04,520
Because, press B, press B

2122
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:05,080
It turns into a crane

2123
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:06,480
And then carry it over

2124
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:06,700
Yeah, yeah

2125
01:26:06,700 --> 01:26:10,280
Yeah, yeah—also throw the sink right in there too

2126
01:26:12,670 --> 01:26:14,090
The sink too

2127
01:26:15,290 --> 01:26:17,910
Threw it in—threw it iiiin!

2128
01:26:17,910 --> 01:26:19,790
Now, take your positions—start!

2129
01:26:20,530 --> 01:26:22,490
Okay! Ah, it’s lagging now

2130
01:26:23,030 --> 01:26:23,330
Yeah

2131
01:26:23,330 --> 01:26:23,810
This is bad right now

2132
01:26:26,850 --> 01:26:27,410
Is it OK?

2133
01:26:28,190 --> 01:26:28,750
Fixed

2134
01:26:29,780 --> 01:26:30,220
This thing

2135
01:26:30,220 --> 01:26:30,840
The crane

2136
01:26:31,260 --> 01:26:31,540
Um…

2137
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:33,800
It won’t start unless this turns into a human

2138
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:34,360
Ah—

2139
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:35,000
This

2140
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,140
Was B finished?

2141
01:26:36,970 --> 01:26:38,030
Ah—already done

2142
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:40,680
Oh no

2143
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,240
Laggy Pekora

2144
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:43,740
Laggy Pekora has arrived

2145
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:44,700
Oh no

2146
01:26:45,550 --> 01:26:46,890
Ah, really—it might be a bit laggy

2147
01:26:47,710 --> 01:26:48,530
Come on, Power Sink!

2148
01:26:48,530 --> 01:26:49,330
Come on, Power Sink!

2149
01:26:49,330 --> 01:26:50,170
Come on, Power Sink!

2150
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:53,100
Is it Power Sink?

2151
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:54,880
Or Soaking?

2152
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:57,560
Why?

2153
01:26:57,720 --> 01:26:57,940
Huh?

2154
01:26:57,940 --> 01:26:58,820
Don’t we need to ring it?

2155
01:27:00,410 --> 01:27:01,370
Yeah, I really forgot

2156
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:06,700
More, more, more

2157
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:08,880
Is this okay?

2158
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:10,680
It makes you nervous, huh?

2159
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:17,520
Hold onto Sana—it’s super cramped

2160
01:27:19,740 --> 01:27:20,760
Already at the limit

2161
01:27:25,710 --> 01:27:27,370
This is day two.

2162
01:27:27,830 --> 01:27:29,050
This is day two.

2163
01:27:30,710 --> 01:27:31,270
After this...

2164
01:27:31,270 --> 01:27:32,810
I guess we'll finish with the two groups outside.

2165
01:27:34,140 --> 01:27:34,940
Easy.

2166
01:27:37,980 --> 01:27:39,680
We're starting to run out of plates.

2167
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:42,500
What part of the water is slippery?

2168
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:43,600
Yes.

2169
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:45,440
Ah, they still haven't noticed.

2170
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:47,340
You're the one who's slippery.

2171
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:51,980
Looked at oil and water.

2172
01:27:51,980 --> 01:27:55,340
Oil is hard to walk on. OK, got it.

2173
01:27:55,880 --> 01:27:57,199
OK, th—

2174
01:28:00,630 --> 01:28:01,490
—is way.

2175
01:28:02,190 --> 01:28:02,650
Alright.

2176
01:28:08,910 --> 01:28:10,770
So, will these two people finish first?

2177
01:28:17,670 --> 01:28:18,990
OK, yes.

2178
01:28:20,260 --> 01:28:21,860
Thank you for the meal.

2179
01:28:22,340 --> 01:28:22,800
OK.

2180
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:24,320
OK, OK.

2181
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:28,089
OK, OK, that's fine.

2182
01:28:28,089 --> 01:28:28,520
That's fine.

2183
01:28:28,980 --> 01:28:31,500
Hurry, hurry! Press the A button here too!

2184
01:28:32,110 --> 01:28:33,460
Shinka, what did you become?

2185
01:28:33,460 --> 01:28:34,780
It's a pre-soak single.

2186
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:37,300
An unnecessary brush has arrived.

2187
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:38,480
Brush, brush!

2188
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:39,420
Brush, brush!

2189
01:28:39,420 --> 01:28:43,000
Nice, nice! The best!

2190
01:28:44,820 --> 01:28:45,180
Thank you very much.

2191
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:46,760
You're a lifesaver.

2192
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:48,620
We don't need anything else.

2193
01:28:50,390 --> 01:28:52,770
I wanted to ask about this...

2194
01:28:53,790 --> 01:28:56,410
When I checked the upgraded version, it looked different.

2195
01:28:56,870 --> 01:28:58,850
At that time, even if I spent 10 yen on the gacha...

2196
01:28:58,850 --> 01:29:00,230
That part won't change.

2197
01:29:01,329 --> 01:29:03,650
It might turn into something completely different.

2198
01:29:03,650 --> 01:29:04,450
It probably has nothing to do with sinks or anything.

2199
01:29:05,610 --> 01:29:06,910
I see, okay, okay, okay.

2200
01:29:11,170 --> 01:29:13,770
The lag is terrible right now, just a bit.

2201
01:29:18,370 --> 01:29:21,230
I have a meeting starting around 9:30.

2202
01:29:21,230 --> 01:29:23,050
I'll take my leave around here.

2203
01:29:23,050 --> 01:29:23,290
Thanks a lot!

2204
01:29:23,290 --> 01:29:24,750
Congratulations!

2205
01:29:26,070 --> 01:29:27,170
Do your best!

2206
01:29:28,550 --> 01:29:29,230
Understood.

2207
01:29:32,330 --> 01:29:34,610
Good thing the area manager came.

2208
01:29:34,610 --> 01:29:38,450
Pecolos wasn't hacked, after all.

2209
01:29:39,230 --> 01:29:40,090
That's true.

2210
01:29:41,210 --> 01:29:42,360
Oh no!

2211
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:43,030
Down below.

2212
01:29:44,370 --> 01:29:45,310
Nice!

2213
01:29:54,150 --> 01:29:55,590
Should we go down this way?

2214
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:01,100
Should we go down this way?

2215
01:30:03,779 --> 01:30:05,760
Please! Please!

2216
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:08,420
Okay, here we go!

2217
01:30:10,650 --> 01:30:12,150
We need some plates, somehow.

2218
01:30:13,150 --> 01:30:15,130
Hey, are they showing up? Maybe we're short on plates.

2219
01:30:15,130 --> 01:30:15,190
Also...

2220
01:30:17,020 --> 01:30:17,820
That's true.

2221
01:30:19,310 --> 01:30:20,790
But washing them...

2222
01:30:21,410 --> 01:30:22,350
...should still be manageable.

2223
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:26,540
Barely.

2224
01:30:29,780 --> 01:30:32,420
If we're fast enough, we won't even need plates.

2225
01:30:36,510 --> 01:30:38,490
Couples aren't coming anymore.

2226
01:30:38,690 --> 01:30:40,090
Looks like couples aren't showing up.

2227
01:30:41,870 --> 01:30:45,810
It's probably because of the reservation over there.

2228
01:30:45,810 --> 01:30:47,370
I see, that makes sense.

2229
01:30:47,790 --> 01:30:51,250
OK, maybe that's fine then.

2230
01:30:51,330 --> 01:30:52,830
Day 3, OK.

2231
01:30:52,830 --> 01:30:53,110
OK.

2232
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:54,880
OK.

2233
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:00,120
Victory.

2234
01:31:00,120 --> 01:31:00,460
Victory.

2235
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:05,780
Press A here quickly, right here—

2236
01:31:05,780 --> 01:31:06,500
Right here, once per day—

2237
01:31:06,780 --> 01:31:07,280
Huh?

2238
01:31:08,490 --> 01:31:11,150
What does 'use the desk once per day' even mean?

2239
01:31:11,150 --> 01:31:11,490
Well, anyway...

2240
01:31:11,490 --> 01:31:12,730
...we've got no other choice but this.

2241
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:15,820
What's a desk?

2242
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:18,380
Desk.

2243
01:31:20,580 --> 01:31:21,970
Reservation desk.

2244
01:31:21,970 --> 01:31:22,540
That's not it, right?

2245
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:24,340
I don't get it. What's going to happen?

2246
01:31:24,340 --> 01:31:24,680
Well, anyway...

2247
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:26,740
...this time slot is still within the 15-minute window, so...

2248
01:31:26,740 --> 01:31:27,240
...just do it randomly.

2249
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:28,440
For now, we gotta throw in some bread quickly.

2250
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:30,000
This is bad, right?

2251
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:32,960
Someone get it!

2252
01:31:33,850 --> 01:31:34,210
No

2253
01:31:34,210 --> 01:31:34,930
Is it Pekora or...?

2254
01:31:35,750 --> 01:31:36,310
Seriously?

2255
01:31:37,450 --> 01:31:38,950
This one, the upgrade thing

2256
01:31:38,950 --> 01:31:39,810
Wanna look?

2257
01:31:39,810 --> 01:31:41,990
I just synced ahead

2258
01:31:41,990 --> 01:31:44,790
Ah, let's buy a sink, this one

2259
01:31:44,790 --> 01:31:45,970
Dining table

2260
01:31:45,970 --> 01:31:47,370
Ah, isn't that the Power-whatsit?

2261
01:31:48,810 --> 01:31:49,870
Let's just buy it

2262
01:31:49,870 --> 01:31:54,250
Let's buy it—Pret too, I guess

2263
01:31:55,470 --> 01:31:56,370
Is it okay if I buy it?

2264
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:01,000
Like, next time or something

2265
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,140
If we do an upgrade or something

2266
01:32:03,140 --> 01:32:05,760
Wouldn't you suddenly max it out all at once?

2267
01:32:06,740 --> 01:32:07,780
Probably not, right?

2268
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:09,340
Next time, I'll try upgrading

2269
01:32:09,340 --> 01:32:11,810
Should I give it a shot once?

2270
01:32:12,450 --> 01:32:14,310
What will it become? Okay!

2271
01:32:15,350 --> 01:32:16,530
Okay

2272
01:32:17,210 --> 01:32:18,590
It turned out awesome

2273
01:32:19,570 --> 01:32:20,850
Getting better

2274
01:32:21,680 --> 01:32:22,400
Hehehe

2275
01:32:23,710 --> 01:32:24,310
And again

2276
01:32:27,290 --> 01:32:29,250
Because of Pekora's lag

2277
01:32:30,690 --> 01:32:31,550
Pekolag

2278
01:32:31,930 --> 01:32:33,030
Here comes Pekolag

2279
01:32:33,030 --> 01:32:34,490
Pekolag Un! Here it comes, here it comes!

2280
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:37,060
Hmm, I upgraded it, but

2281
01:32:37,060 --> 01:32:39,160
I don't know what it became—OK!

2282
01:32:41,910 --> 01:32:42,390
Ris

2283
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:43,850
Previously upgraded the herb

2284
01:32:45,209 --> 01:32:46,250
Come on, come, come

2285
01:32:46,250 --> 01:32:46,750
Come on, come on

2286
01:32:47,190 --> 01:32:47,550
Not there

2287
01:32:49,010 --> 01:32:51,490
Normally I use herbs

2288
01:32:51,490 --> 01:32:54,650
Pekora-senpai, Pekora's in trouble

2289
01:32:54,650 --> 01:32:57,190
I can't even handle my own lag anymore

2290
01:32:57,190 --> 01:32:58,510
This is crazy, crazy, crazy

2291
01:32:58,510 --> 01:32:59,050
Crazy, crazy

2292
01:33:00,690 --> 01:33:01,430
Alright, okay

2293
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:05,520
Thank you very much

2294
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:08,120
Ah, forgot

2295
01:33:13,900 --> 01:33:18,980
Power Brush, Scrap Brush, Scrap, Scrap

2296
01:33:20,860 --> 01:33:25,350
Scrap, scrap, scrap

2297
01:33:25,350 --> 01:33:25,810
Scrap

2298
01:33:38,470 --> 01:33:38,910
Like

2299
01:33:38,910 --> 01:33:40,890
Even more so on that side

2300
01:33:40,890 --> 01:33:42,010
If that's the case

2301
01:33:42,010 --> 01:33:44,650
If you could put it closer on this side

2302
01:33:45,570 --> 01:33:49,450
I feel like I could do it whenever I want

2303
01:33:49,450 --> 01:33:50,350
A dog holding hands

2304
01:33:52,030 --> 01:33:54,930
Is Pekora, the lag user, going now?

2305
01:33:54,930 --> 01:33:56,290
It might be turning into something like that

2306
01:33:56,290 --> 01:33:57,890
Everyone's moving weirdly

2307
01:34:00,610 --> 01:34:02,730
It's fine, we can still do it, Suu-chan

2308
01:34:02,730 --> 01:34:03,750
I'm covering for you, right?

2309
01:34:03,750 --> 01:34:04,330
We'll keep going

2310
01:34:04,990 --> 01:34:05,810
Sorry about that

2311
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:09,940
Pekora's moving weirdly though

2312
01:34:09,940 --> 01:34:10,280
That's bad

2313
01:34:10,700 --> 01:34:12,380
Send it over, please

2314
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:15,240
Everyone's on international teams

2315
01:34:15,240 --> 01:34:16,680
Does everyone have lag?

2316
01:34:16,680 --> 01:34:18,340
Everyone's on international teams

2317
01:34:18,340 --> 01:34:18,960
That's true

2318
01:34:20,930 --> 01:34:21,250
No

2319
01:34:21,250 --> 01:34:23,010
Pekora's already trying to wrap things up

2320
01:34:23,010 --> 01:34:24,680
Suzui-chan's handling everything

2321
01:34:25,020 --> 01:34:25,840
So that's why this is happening

2322
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:28,780
Seriously, why does it always end up like this with me?

2323
01:34:28,780 --> 01:34:31,320
I've always thought this about this guy, yeah

2324
01:34:31,320 --> 01:34:32,340
Maybe I already messed up

2325
01:34:32,340 --> 01:34:33,560
Right there, Pekora-senpai

2326
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:35,120
Isn't it over there? Faster

2327
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:36,200
Before I knew it

2328
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:39,420
Aku and Pekora don't even know who that is

2329
01:34:40,620 --> 01:34:42,420
Because they're fighting Lagzo

2330
01:34:42,420 --> 01:34:43,620
Seriously?!

2331
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:45,790
Ah, um

2332
01:34:45,790 --> 01:34:47,800
Became Safety Hope

2333
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:51,719
Ah, getting late kinda sucks

2334
01:34:51,839 --> 01:34:52,700
But it won't burn

2335
01:34:52,700 --> 01:34:53,420
Hey, what's going on?

2336
01:34:53,420 --> 01:34:56,240
Maybe we don't need Risu-chan.

2337
01:34:56,240 --> 01:34:58,490
We don't need her, nope, don't need her.

2338
01:34:58,490 --> 01:34:59,240
Okay, okay!

2339
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:01,540
Seems fine as it is.

2340
01:35:04,780 --> 01:35:06,060
Let's give it a try.

2341
01:35:06,060 --> 01:35:06,900
Let's give it a try.

2342
01:35:07,580 --> 01:35:08,220
If there's a Safety Hoop,

2343
01:35:08,220 --> 01:35:09,940
I'd like them to upgrade it.

2344
01:35:12,940 --> 01:35:14,320
I really want to do it again, honestly.

2345
01:35:14,820 --> 01:35:15,920
Let's try it once more.

2346
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:17,820
Maybe something good will come along.

2347
01:35:17,820 --> 01:35:18,540
That was quick.

2348
01:35:20,860 --> 01:35:21,180
OK.

2349
01:35:34,900 --> 01:35:36,440
Yes! Here it comes, here it comes!

2350
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,140
Solo player.

2351
01:35:43,140 --> 01:35:44,240
Let them in first.

2352
01:35:51,050 --> 01:35:52,250
So fast!

2353
01:35:52,330 --> 01:35:54,050
Oh, so quick!

2354
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:56,480
Oh, quickly—good!

2355
01:35:57,500 --> 01:36:01,460
Yeah, oh, quickly—going down!

2356
01:36:01,460 --> 01:36:04,080
Going down, yep—going down!

2357
01:36:04,860 --> 01:36:06,820
Is it really okay to go this fast?

2358
01:36:07,410 --> 01:36:08,870
It's fine, yeah!

2359
01:36:15,650 --> 01:36:17,350
These two are off, aren't they?

2360
01:36:19,250 --> 01:36:19,960
Oh no!

2361
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:20,470
Wait!

2362
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:28,540
Like this—and yes!

2363
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:33,660
Stop it quickly!

2364
01:36:33,660 --> 01:36:34,060
Stop it quickly!

2365
01:36:42,450 --> 01:36:43,090
Are you okay?

2366
01:36:43,630 --> 01:36:43,950
I'm fine.

2367
01:36:47,150 --> 01:36:47,470
Huh?

2368
01:36:47,470 --> 01:36:48,090
Logging in...

2369
01:36:48,130 --> 01:36:48,410
Ah—

2370
01:36:48,410 --> 01:36:48,870
Logging in...

2371
01:36:49,070 --> 01:36:49,330
Oh no!

2372
01:36:49,330 --> 01:36:52,570
Dug dug! Everyone, Dug—it's bad!

2373
01:36:52,570 --> 01:36:53,950
Everyone, dug dug dug!

2374
01:36:53,950 --> 01:36:56,450
It's bad—I can't grab it!

2375
01:37:01,870 --> 01:37:03,650
Come on, come on!

2376
01:37:03,650 --> 01:37:04,890
Quickly, okay!

2377
01:37:04,890 --> 01:37:11,310
Okay, it might be over, it might be over!

2378
01:37:11,310 --> 01:37:13,810
Might be game over now.

2379
01:37:16,060 --> 01:37:17,020
I see...

2380
01:37:18,680 --> 01:37:20,540
Actually feels pretty good.

2381
01:37:22,910 --> 01:37:24,910
What levels are you guys at?

2382
01:37:26,020 --> 01:37:27,300
Where can you check your level?

2383
01:37:28,380 --> 01:37:30,340
Ah, I'm level 6 right now—level 6!

2384
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:32,340
Oh, then...

2385
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:34,440
This bottom-right corner...

2386
01:37:35,020 --> 01:37:37,700
Uh, um, here—right here!

2387
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:39,600
It doesn't show the level here.

2388
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:41,420
Mine says 6 too, though.

2389
01:37:41,900 --> 01:37:44,500
Ah, Pekora also says level 6.

2390
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:47,680
Everyone's around the same level.

2391
01:37:47,680 --> 01:37:48,760
Eh? What about Risu-chan?

2392
01:37:50,270 --> 01:37:51,789
I'm 6—huh?

2393
01:37:51,789 --> 01:37:52,570
Then we're the same.

2394
01:37:54,210 --> 01:37:58,030
What's Disen-senpai's level?

2395
01:37:58,710 --> 01:37:59,470
Maybe?

2396
01:38:00,330 --> 01:38:01,130
I see...

2397
01:38:02,240 --> 01:38:03,620
How do you even check your own level?

2398
01:38:17,370 --> 01:38:20,110
We might need to disband once.

2399
01:38:20,510 --> 01:38:23,290
To raise our own levels,

2400
01:38:32,110 --> 01:38:33,570
let's disband once

2401
01:38:33,570 --> 01:38:37,750
and then make a room together again.

2402
01:38:37,750 --> 01:38:41,490
Apparently, we all get experience points.

2403
01:38:41,490 --> 01:38:43,510
We don't get them right now,

2404
01:38:43,510 --> 01:38:45,350
but we'll get them after disbanding, it seems.

2405
01:38:45,350 --> 01:38:47,980
What should we do?

2406
01:38:49,120 --> 01:38:51,160
Shall we disband once?

2407
01:38:52,399 --> 01:38:53,940
We could stay like this, but...

2408
01:38:55,230 --> 01:38:58,610
Level 6 is just right anyway,

2409
01:38:58,989 --> 01:39:01,290
so we can make hamburgers.

2410
01:39:01,290 --> 01:39:02,690
But, you know, on the day itself,

2411
01:39:02,690 --> 01:39:05,530
even if it ends up like this, there's nothing we can do.

2412
01:39:05,530 --> 01:39:05,930
Because...

2413
01:39:05,930 --> 01:39:07,670
it's happening worldwide.

2414
01:39:07,670 --> 01:39:10,230
If Su-chan or Pekora

2415
01:39:10,230 --> 01:39:12,150
or the senpai reaches level 6,

2416
01:39:12,150 --> 01:39:14,610
either of them can open a room,

2417
01:39:14,610 --> 01:39:16,970
which might make things a bit better.

2418
01:39:17,570 --> 01:39:20,630
But that might make Kiara-chan or

2419
01:39:20,630 --> 01:39:24,810
Risu-chan even more laggy, I think.

2420
01:39:25,450 --> 01:39:27,770
Someone will probably lag.

2421
01:39:28,190 --> 01:39:30,210
I feel like Cook is important.

2422
01:39:30,210 --> 01:39:32,390
Maybe it's still best to have Rissu-chan do it after all.

2423
01:39:32,390 --> 01:39:33,190
Rissu-chan is the best.

2424
01:39:33,190 --> 01:39:35,910
It just means it's easier to create in an environment that's more comfortable for me, right?

2425
01:39:38,929 --> 01:39:40,470
That wouldn't be bad either, though.

2426
01:39:40,470 --> 01:39:42,670
If we try it once with just the Japanese members,

2427
01:39:42,670 --> 01:39:45,950
we might actually see whether there's lag or not.

2428
01:39:45,950 --> 01:39:52,190
Maybe...

2429
01:39:52,220 --> 01:39:55,700
Fa—

2430
01:39:57,060 --> 01:40:15,940
n—

2431
01:40:17,090 --> 01:40:18,850
Members

2432
01:40:18,870 --> 01:40:19,330
Oh no!

2433
01:40:19,330 --> 01:40:20,710
The speed-up itself just dropped.

2434
01:40:21,740 --> 01:40:22,300
So like this,

2435
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:24,740
Lip Trio

2436
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:26,080
OK

2437
01:40:28,580 --> 01:40:28,860
Ah—

2438
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:31,060
And then, again, that thing...

2439
01:40:31,060 --> 01:40:32,520
I wonder what level it's at now.

2440
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:34,520
Huh? This hasn't leveled up at all!

2441
01:40:36,450 --> 01:40:37,590
Th-th-th-that th-th-th-that

2442
01:40:37,590 --> 01:40:41,110
Is it the one you get when you leave the room?

2443
01:40:44,490 --> 01:40:46,110
Maybe it's level 1.

2444
01:40:47,030 --> 01:40:47,810
No way!

2445
01:40:50,100 --> 01:40:50,900
I've

2446
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:52,360
leveled up.

2447
01:40:54,060 --> 01:40:55,240
I went up to level 3.

2448
01:40:55,240 --> 01:40:56,340
Yeah, it went up to level 3.

2449
01:40:56,920 --> 01:40:58,560
Look over there.

2450
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:01,300
Next to the tutorial on the left,

2451
01:41:01,300 --> 01:41:02,960
aren't some points dropped there?

2452
01:41:03,870 --> 01:41:05,430
Points—wait a sec.

2453
01:41:05,430 --> 01:41:06,430
Tutorial

2454
01:41:07,720 --> 01:41:13,340
There should be something dropped next to the tutorial.

2455
01:41:14,600 --> 01:41:14,960
I see.

2456
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:18,520
Hmm, but since we're still only level 3,

2457
01:41:18,520 --> 01:41:20,030
we probably don't have enough yet, right?

2458
01:41:20,030 --> 01:41:21,340
Yeah, exactly, exactly.

2459
01:41:21,340 --> 01:41:24,360
We probably need around level 4 or so.

2460
01:41:25,200 --> 01:41:25,960
OK, then

2461
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:28,700
I'll still rely on Rissu-chan, okay?

2462
01:41:28,700 --> 01:41:30,300
That's our only option. Sorry.

2463
01:41:30,300 --> 01:41:31,320
Could you call her again?

2464
01:41:31,320 --> 01:41:31,920
Pekoran

2465
01:41:33,580 --> 01:41:34,920
Please check out our Instagram!

2466
01:41:36,340 --> 01:41:36,780
Thank you!

2467
01:41:37,540 --> 01:41:38,520
Next time,

2468
01:41:38,520 --> 01:41:41,960
maybe we should properly time ourselves and try it.

2469
01:41:41,960 --> 01:41:44,460
Like, how many stages we can clear in 15 minutes,

2470
01:41:44,460 --> 01:41:45,100
that sounds good.

2471
01:41:45,580 --> 01:41:47,080
Should we time it?

2472
01:41:48,120 --> 01:41:49,740
Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.

2473
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:54,460
Instagram is ready.

2474
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:56,040
Yes.

2475
01:41:56,040 --> 01:41:57,360
Instagram is ready.

2476
01:41:58,340 --> 01:41:59,260
I'm back.

2477
01:42:00,590 --> 01:42:01,250
I'm back.

2478
01:42:03,610 --> 01:42:05,150
Shu-chan, should we time it?

2479
01:42:06,090 --> 01:42:07,610
Right now, the timer thing—

2480
01:42:08,690 --> 01:42:09,990
Thanks, there's no bar.

2481
01:42:09,990 --> 01:42:12,050
How do we check that again?

2482
01:42:13,170 --> 01:42:14,050
Gacha, maybe?

2483
01:42:15,090 --> 01:42:15,870
The timer thing—

2484
01:42:15,870 --> 01:42:17,930
How did we look it up again?

2485
01:42:18,510 --> 01:42:19,010
Timer

2486
01:42:19,830 --> 01:42:21,810
Timer or stopwatch—

2487
01:42:22,610 --> 01:42:22,930
Thank you very much.

2488
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:32,040
There are only three people.

2489
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:33,240
Huh?

2490
01:42:37,870 --> 01:42:38,090
Hm?

2491
01:42:38,090 --> 01:42:38,550
Huh?

2492
01:42:39,380 --> 01:42:39,740
Huh?

2493
01:42:43,070 --> 01:42:43,670
Ah, sorry.

2494
01:42:43,670 --> 01:42:44,550
Pekorea

2495
01:42:50,470 --> 01:42:52,190
Ki—

2496
01:42:54,590 --> 01:42:54,930
—e

2497
01:43:00,780 --> 01:43:02,220
There's no burger, huh?

2498
01:43:02,220 --> 01:43:03,280
Nope—not here! Here I am!

2499
01:43:07,160 --> 01:43:08,620
What are you gonna do about this?

2500
01:43:10,150 --> 01:43:10,510
Again?

2501
01:43:10,510 --> 01:43:11,190
Guccho, maybe?

2502
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:12,360
Okay.

2503
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:14,980
Aki was kinda far away.

2504
01:43:18,310 --> 01:43:18,670
Oh!

2505
01:43:19,780 --> 01:43:20,560
Why are you outside?

2506
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:21,190
Eh, something's wrong!

2507
01:43:21,190 --> 01:43:22,470
Are you in another world or something? Hey!

2508
01:43:22,470 --> 01:43:23,240
Wait, what?

2509
01:43:23,320 --> 01:43:23,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

2510
01:43:24,260 --> 01:43:24,980
Don't go in!

2511
01:43:26,300 --> 01:43:27,140
Why outside

2512
01:43:28,040 --> 01:43:28,800
I wonder why

2513
01:43:33,830 --> 01:43:34,830
Huh? Not there

2514
01:43:35,490 --> 01:43:36,870
Huh? It's not coming out at all?

2515
01:43:36,870 --> 01:43:37,740
Suddenly, I

2516
01:43:37,740 --> 01:43:38,290
Why?

2517
01:43:39,410 --> 01:43:41,710
Ah, it means I should properly do the tutorial

2518
01:43:43,090 --> 01:43:43,810
That's what it means

2519
01:43:56,660 --> 01:43:57,680
Sakanaa

2520
01:43:58,780 --> 01:43:59,460
Ah

2521
01:44:01,820 --> 01:44:02,740
There's Burgan, there's Burgan

2522
01:44:03,380 --> 01:44:04,100
Nice, nice

2523
01:44:04,100 --> 01:44:04,520
Niiice

2524
01:44:06,470 --> 01:44:07,989
Hamburger, and then

2525
01:44:07,989 --> 01:44:10,350
I guess I need to put in another seed

2526
01:44:12,670 --> 01:44:13,390
Still know it

2527
01:44:14,700 --> 01:44:15,120
Know it

2528
01:44:16,360 --> 01:44:16,720
OK

2529
01:44:17,380 --> 01:44:18,040
Beautiful

2530
01:44:18,860 --> 01:44:20,000
Yeah!

2531
01:44:20,720 --> 01:44:23,100
Then, once Suu-chan joins later

2532
01:44:23,100 --> 01:44:26,110
Wait a moment, please

2533
01:44:38,290 --> 01:44:39,250
In that case

2534
01:44:39,250 --> 01:44:41,910
I'll measure it with my phone. Ah, but

2535
01:44:41,910 --> 01:44:42,660
To the embassy

2536
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:52,660
Made it

2537
01:44:53,540 --> 01:44:54,619
Yay!

2538
01:44:55,940 --> 01:44:58,160
Is the room invite coming?

2539
01:44:58,160 --> 01:45:01,120
Joining the room from Riss-chan

2540
01:45:02,140 --> 01:45:03,460
Only the color gets in

2541
01:45:04,550 --> 01:45:06,550
This isn't the real Suu-chan

2542
01:45:08,450 --> 01:45:09,790
Made it darker. Good, good

2543
01:45:11,270 --> 01:45:12,430
OK OK OK

2544
01:45:13,610 --> 01:45:14,240
Alright

2545
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:17,010
How far can we get in 15 minutes?

2546
01:45:18,370 --> 01:45:21,270
It's already been four hours since start

2547
01:45:21,390 --> 01:45:24,530
Ah, okay, start

2548
01:45:24,530 --> 01:45:27,210
Button bububu, okay

2549
01:45:28,630 --> 01:45:32,010
And, uh, it's Boking, Boking

2550
01:45:32,010 --> 01:45:34,390
Can be put into the machine

2551
01:45:34,430 --> 01:45:34,700
Well

2552
01:45:34,700 --> 01:45:37,630
Maybe it's fine to walk here, but

2553
01:45:37,630 --> 01:45:42,810
This is important again

2554
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:52,240
Hmm

2555
01:45:53,510 --> 01:45:56,920
I'll put it here for now

2556
01:45:56,920 --> 01:45:58,460
Nikkey Arabao Okay

2557
01:46:00,040 --> 01:46:01,580
Nikkey Arabao Okay

2558
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:05,380
This one also doesn't have 15 minutes left, right?

2559
01:46:05,380 --> 01:46:06,940
Yes, yes, yes, yes

2560
01:46:07,780 --> 01:46:09,880
It's 14 minutes and 21 seconds now

2561
01:46:11,400 --> 01:46:12,140
Let's go

2562
01:46:12,140 --> 01:46:12,449
Let's go

2563
01:46:12,449 --> 01:46:12,760
Let's go

2564
01:46:12,820 --> 01:46:13,560
This should work

2565
01:46:20,520 --> 01:46:21,350
Here it comes

2566
01:46:21,350 --> 01:46:21,720
Here it comes

2567
01:46:23,460 --> 01:46:24,580
It's here! It came, it came!

2568
01:46:27,210 --> 01:46:28,650
Burger's ready—it's already nighttime

2569
01:46:29,350 --> 01:46:29,710
Okay

2570
01:46:34,670 --> 01:46:35,670
Burger bar

2571
01:46:35,670 --> 01:46:36,790
Gar burger bar

2572
01:46:36,790 --> 01:46:37,210
Gar burger bar

2573
01:46:37,210 --> 01:46:37,970
Gar burger

2574
01:46:37,970 --> 01:46:38,640
Oh no

2575
01:46:38,640 --> 01:46:39,310
Oh no

2576
01:46:39,950 --> 01:46:40,490
What happened?

2577
01:46:40,770 --> 01:46:42,890
It's bad, seriously bad already

2578
01:46:42,890 --> 01:46:43,370
Already bad

2579
01:46:46,690 --> 01:46:48,090
What happened?

2580
01:46:48,090 --> 01:46:49,890
People passed by too quickly

2581
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:52,780
Lag

2582
01:46:52,780 --> 01:46:53,370
No

2583
01:46:53,370 --> 01:46:57,540
Probably just not enough seats

2584
01:46:59,240 --> 01:47:01,300
Ah, maybe booking a bit earlier

2585
01:47:01,300 --> 01:47:02,180
Probably

2586
01:47:02,180 --> 01:47:04,920
We need to move one person first

2587
01:47:04,920 --> 01:47:05,840
Maybe that's it

2588
01:47:06,520 --> 01:47:07,560
Ah, I see

2589
01:47:07,560 --> 01:47:08,320
Chiri chiri, chirin

2590
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:11,140
When you do that, you can't go anymore

2591
01:47:12,410 --> 01:47:13,110
Then

2592
01:47:13,110 --> 01:47:14,310
One person gets priority

2593
01:47:19,610 --> 01:47:23,270
Initially, it's better if all reservations are filled

2594
01:47:23,270 --> 01:47:25,230
Didn't someone say something like that? Is it okay?

2595
01:47:26,310 --> 01:47:27,110
It's fine

2596
01:47:31,020 --> 01:47:34,240
Take this first

2597
01:47:37,060 --> 01:47:39,100
Do it like this

2598
01:47:47,590 --> 01:47:48,470
Ya

2599
01:47:51,630 --> 01:47:54,230
Baiya

2600
01:47:54,280 --> 01:47:55,250
Baiya bai

2601
01:47:59,130 --> 01:47:59,910
Oh no

2602
01:48:00,930 --> 01:48:01,810
It's okay

2603
01:48:09,070 --> 01:48:11,470
Whoa, they're hitting!

2604
01:48:12,210 --> 01:48:12,910
They're hitting

2605
01:48:15,100 --> 01:48:15,460
They're overcoming it

2606
01:48:15,460 --> 01:48:16,800
It's okay, they're overcoming it

2607
01:48:36,470 --> 01:48:38,230
The plate I grabbed

2608
01:48:38,230 --> 01:48:39,890
is back on the desk where it was originally

2609
01:48:39,890 --> 01:48:40,870
What’s going on?

2610
01:48:44,470 --> 01:48:44,830
Well

2611
01:48:44,830 --> 01:48:46,910
Anyway, nice, nice

2612
01:48:46,910 --> 01:48:47,730
Nice, nice

2613
01:48:47,730 --> 01:48:50,910
Nice—what’ll come out?

2614
01:48:51,230 --> 01:48:52,130
Sink, sink

2615
01:48:52,130 --> 01:48:53,470
Upgrade

2616
01:48:53,470 --> 01:48:55,090
Desk Mario upgrade

2617
01:48:55,750 --> 01:48:57,090
Can I put it here?

2618
01:48:57,210 --> 01:48:57,580
Um

2619
01:48:57,580 --> 01:48:59,250
With the floating one

2620
01:49:00,500 --> 01:49:02,040
Please, thank you

2621
01:49:02,040 --> 01:49:06,520
Thank you, thank you—put it

2622
01:49:06,940 --> 01:49:08,880
First, this one

2623
01:49:10,210 --> 01:49:15,830
Okay, okay, okay

2624
01:49:15,830 --> 01:49:16,130
Okay

2625
01:49:16,130 --> 01:49:16,230
Okay

2626
01:49:17,490 --> 01:49:18,190
Good, good

2627
01:49:19,670 --> 01:49:20,470
Alright, let's go

2628
01:49:22,130 --> 01:49:23,770
Power Sink, come on

2629
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:26,780
Yeah, we really need that Power Sink

2630
01:49:26,780 --> 01:49:27,460
Ah

2631
01:49:27,460 --> 01:49:31,640
It got on the dishwasher—I don't want it

2632
01:49:33,510 --> 01:49:35,150
Yes, here it comes, here it comes

2633
01:49:35,150 --> 01:49:36,150
Pekora, oh no

2634
01:49:36,150 --> 01:49:36,330
That

2635
01:49:37,450 --> 01:49:38,850
Seriously, this is bad

2636
01:49:38,850 --> 01:49:40,510
Right now, there's Pekora from Razsky

2637
01:49:42,290 --> 01:49:43,790
Wait, okay okay, hold on

2638
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:46,720
This is already bad

2639
01:49:46,720 --> 01:49:48,580
Nothing’s staying in Pekora’s hands anymore

2640
01:49:48,580 --> 01:49:49,420
Okay, okay

2641
01:49:49,420 --> 01:49:50,100
They won’t take it

2642
01:49:50,100 --> 01:49:50,920
This plate

2643
01:49:57,020 --> 01:49:58,220
Oh no, oh no, oh no

2644
01:49:58,220 --> 01:49:58,380
Already

2645
01:49:59,040 --> 01:50:01,880
I’m always holding a plate with no burger

2646
01:50:02,980 --> 01:50:03,880
Put that down

2647
01:50:05,080 --> 01:50:06,120
I’ve got the burger

2648
01:50:06,120 --> 01:50:07,200
Pekora’s got it, got it, got it

2649
01:50:07,200 --> 01:50:09,350
Alright, alright

2650
01:50:09,350 --> 01:50:09,790
Done, done

2651
01:50:10,630 --> 01:50:14,530
Seriously, Pekora, oh no, oh no, oh no

2652
01:50:14,530 --> 01:50:15,710
Plate, please, plate

2653
01:50:15,710 --> 01:50:16,590
Plate, please

2654
01:50:19,800 --> 01:50:20,700
Wait, hold on

2655
01:50:21,510 --> 01:50:23,270
Oh no, oh no—it’s over

2656
01:50:23,270 --> 01:50:24,010
What are they gonna say?

2657
01:50:24,010 --> 01:50:25,550
Nukari-senpai, put that down, Nukari-senpai

2658
01:50:25,550 --> 01:50:27,870
Put that down—where, where?

2659
01:50:27,870 --> 01:50:29,030
Where?

2660
01:50:33,210 --> 01:50:34,940
Hard mode, huh

2661
01:50:34,940 --> 01:50:35,930
Then it’s a challenge

2662
01:50:37,530 --> 01:50:39,290
Ah, but things are getting smoother—oh no

2663
01:50:39,290 --> 01:50:39,590
Showed it

2664
01:50:40,110 --> 01:50:40,430
Huh?

2665
01:50:41,590 --> 01:50:42,820
Yes yes yes yes ah

2666
01:50:43,930 --> 01:50:45,210
Oh no, oh no, oh no

2667
01:50:45,490 --> 01:50:47,470
The person at bottom left is angry

2668
01:50:47,470 --> 01:50:47,970
OK, OK

2669
01:50:47,970 --> 01:50:48,330
OK

2670
01:50:48,770 --> 01:50:49,410
Going, going

2671
01:50:50,810 --> 01:50:51,430
Hey

2672
01:50:52,070 --> 01:50:54,190
I can’t do this

2673
01:50:54,190 --> 01:50:54,870
Can I make it unreadable?

2674
01:50:54,870 --> 01:50:55,890
Fukashima’s holding it, holding it

2675
01:50:55,890 --> 01:50:57,070
Hold it—give it to someone

2676
01:50:57,070 --> 01:50:58,750
Give it to someone—ah, kekeke

2677
01:50:58,750 --> 01:50:59,550
Hold this, hold this

2678
01:50:59,550 --> 01:51:01,110
Got it, OK OK OK OK

2679
01:51:02,500 --> 01:51:03,460
Successfully handed it off

2680
01:51:03,460 --> 01:51:04,640
Already handed it over

2681
01:51:04,640 --> 01:51:07,580
Handed it off—only holding the burger

2682
01:51:08,490 --> 01:51:09,510
Ah, not holding it now

2683
01:51:09,510 --> 01:51:11,990
Right now, I’m not holding anything

2684
01:51:11,990 --> 01:51:13,870
Pekora, here it comes, here it comes

2685
01:51:15,050 --> 01:51:16,250
That’s Pekora-senpai

2686
01:51:16,650 --> 01:51:19,770
There’s a box at bottom right

2687
01:51:22,670 --> 01:51:24,070
Why a burger?

2688
01:51:24,990 --> 01:51:26,950
Plate, please. A plate.

2689
01:51:26,950 --> 01:51:28,250
A dirty plate.

2690
01:51:29,650 --> 01:51:31,790
A dirty plate... but maybe it's fine now?

2691
01:51:31,790 --> 01:51:32,130
Ah—

2692
01:51:32,130 --> 01:51:33,730
I still want one more after all.

2693
01:51:34,750 --> 01:51:36,790
OK OK OK, oh no, right now—

2694
01:51:36,790 --> 01:51:39,230
I have no idea what Pekora is even looking at or doing.

2695
01:51:39,230 --> 01:51:39,950
Go ahead, go ahead!

2696
01:51:39,950 --> 01:51:41,070
Thank you so much! Made it just in time—

2697
01:51:41,450 --> 01:51:42,030
OK, got it!

2698
01:51:45,050 --> 01:51:46,950
This is bad—the world everyone else sees

2699
01:51:46,950 --> 01:51:49,510
and the world Pekora sees are way too different!

2700
01:51:49,510 --> 01:51:50,870
Pekora’s gone off the rails!

2701
01:51:51,810 --> 01:51:53,430
I don’t even know what that was, but...

2702
01:51:55,850 --> 01:51:57,670
What she’s doing is actually kind of nice.

2703
01:51:57,670 --> 01:51:58,910
It’s already over before I knew it.

2704
01:51:58,910 --> 01:52:00,330
This is scary...

2705
01:52:02,590 --> 01:52:05,310
I think I’ll just move on to the next thing.

2706
01:52:05,310 --> 01:52:06,130
Or maybe...

2707
01:52:06,130 --> 01:52:09,130
I could reroll with Blue Prince, but...

2708
01:52:10,200 --> 01:52:11,520
We got a sink!

2709
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:12,880
Should we do the sink?

2710
01:52:13,120 --> 01:52:15,440
But, since we already entered the sink...

2711
01:52:15,440 --> 01:52:18,280
it didn’t give us the item we wanted.

2712
01:52:18,280 --> 01:52:19,180
Alright then, let’s—

2713
01:52:19,180 --> 01:52:20,040
Let’s go!

2714
01:52:23,610 --> 01:52:24,310
But...

2715
01:52:24,310 --> 01:52:26,150
Brush hasn’t dropped yet, either...

2716
01:52:26,670 --> 01:52:27,410
Wait, right now—

2717
01:52:27,410 --> 01:52:28,570
There might’ve been a Multi Brush!

2718
01:52:29,230 --> 01:52:29,630
Huh?

2719
01:52:31,350 --> 01:52:31,750
No way!

2720
01:52:32,190 --> 01:52:32,970
It’s over already?!

2721
01:52:33,550 --> 01:52:34,490
But, Power Sink...

2722
01:52:34,490 --> 01:52:36,300
is probably definitely not it.

2723
01:52:36,300 --> 01:52:38,590
Soaking again—but it’s not the item I wanted.

2724
01:52:39,450 --> 01:52:40,190
Okay.

2725
01:52:47,230 --> 01:52:50,590
This is bad—I can’t get it no matter what!

2726
01:52:50,590 --> 01:52:51,570
I’m getting it! I’m getting it!

2727
01:52:51,570 --> 01:52:56,490
When luck’s bad, you end up stuck with Low-Low, like, Low-Low...

2728
01:52:56,490 --> 01:52:58,090
There! Right there, right there!

2729
01:52:58,770 --> 01:53:00,910
From my perspective, that unlock is necessary.

2730
01:53:00,910 --> 01:53:02,810
Right now, right now, Senpai Pekora—

2731
01:53:02,810 --> 01:53:05,670
is holding a dirty plate—a dirty plate, seriously?!

2732
01:53:05,670 --> 01:53:06,310
Don’t mess with me!

2733
01:53:06,310 --> 01:53:06,790
I don’t get it!

2734
01:53:06,790 --> 01:53:06,990
This...

2735
01:53:07,330 --> 01:53:08,330
That’s another dirty plate!

2736
01:53:08,330 --> 01:53:09,990
Senpai Pekora, please put that back!

2737
01:53:12,070 --> 01:53:13,690
She was supposed to be holding a burger, but...

2738
01:53:13,690 --> 01:53:14,890
somehow turned into a dirty plate instead.

2739
01:53:14,890 --> 01:53:15,370
Before I even realized...

2740
01:53:19,050 --> 01:53:20,230
Another dirty plate!

2741
01:53:20,230 --> 01:53:21,970
What’s going on?! Did someone put this here?!

2742
01:53:21,970 --> 01:53:23,630
Seriously, Senpai Pekora...

2743
01:53:23,630 --> 01:53:24,790
I think she’s drunk.

2744
01:53:24,790 --> 01:53:26,260
No, it’s not that—

2745
01:53:26,260 --> 01:53:27,810
The world Bekora sees

2746
01:53:27,810 --> 01:53:30,010
is just slightly different from what everyone else sees—it’s insane!

2747
01:53:30,010 --> 01:53:31,250
Fukura-senpai, you’re in the way!

2748
01:53:31,370 --> 01:53:34,850
Fukura-senpai, you’re in the way!

2749
01:53:35,070 --> 01:53:35,950
Fukura-senpai, you’re in the way!

2750
01:53:36,130 --> 01:53:37,620
Plate!

2751
01:53:37,620 --> 01:53:38,210
Plate!

2752
01:53:38,210 --> 01:53:38,690
Plate!

2753
01:53:38,810 --> 01:53:39,030
Plate!

2754
01:53:39,030 --> 01:53:39,250
Plate!

2755
01:53:39,250 --> 01:53:39,850
Plate!

2756
01:53:39,930 --> 01:53:40,000
Plate!

2757
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:40,210
Plate!

2758
01:53:40,210 --> 01:53:40,410
Plate!

2759
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:45,980
You’re blocking the way!

2760
01:53:47,860 --> 01:53:48,760
I get it, I get it!

2761
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:51,560
She was trying her best, really trying!

2762
01:53:51,560 --> 01:53:55,060
Brush! Brush! Brush! Brush! Brush!

2763
01:53:55,060 --> 01:53:56,880
Please! This one, this one, this one, this one!

2764
01:53:58,920 --> 01:54:00,260
It ended before I even noticed!

2765
01:54:01,520 --> 01:54:01,840
Amazing!

2766
01:54:02,900 --> 01:54:04,200
I just moved the sink by accident.

2767
01:54:06,510 --> 01:54:08,030
Ah, there actually is a Multi-Brush!

2768
01:54:08,030 --> 01:54:08,810
Nice! Nice!

2769
01:54:08,810 --> 01:54:09,150
Nice!

2770
01:54:11,700 --> 01:54:12,480
Shall we go?

2771
01:54:13,670 --> 01:54:14,020
Yes.

2772
01:54:14,020 --> 01:54:14,630
Let’s go.

2773
01:54:15,570 --> 01:54:17,770
Since I accidentally moved the sink just now...

2774
01:54:17,889 --> 01:54:20,030
I’ll leave just the sink positioning to you.

2775
01:54:20,860 --> 01:54:21,190
Got it.

2776
01:54:21,190 --> 01:54:22,820
OK here.

2777
01:54:27,310 --> 01:54:28,210
Let's go.

2778
01:54:31,090 --> 01:54:32,550
Right now, I'm going blind,

2779
01:54:32,550 --> 01:54:35,030
so I barely even know what I'm thinking myself.

2780
01:54:35,030 --> 01:54:36,350
Just tell me what you're thinking.

2781
01:54:36,350 --> 01:54:40,250
You'd probably say something like, 'Please stay down there.'

2782
01:54:42,280 --> 01:54:45,280
The world has somehow moved way too far ahead,

2783
01:54:45,280 --> 01:54:47,120
and turned into a scary future—yeah, that's right.

2784
01:54:47,120 --> 01:54:48,720
Even Senpai Pekora isn't around.

2785
01:54:48,720 --> 01:54:49,960
She went to see a customer,

2786
01:54:49,960 --> 01:54:51,060
so I thought, 'Yeah, that must be it.'

2787
01:54:51,479 --> 01:54:51,799
Huh?

2788
01:54:56,110 --> 01:55:00,190
Can you get two soaking sinks in a row?

2789
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:04,580
You're holding a plate right now, aren't you?

2790
01:55:05,280 --> 01:55:06,200
Is this a plate?

2791
01:55:08,460 --> 01:55:09,440
Is this a burger?

2792
01:55:10,570 --> 01:55:12,190
Maybe you're not holding it right now.

2793
01:55:13,470 --> 01:55:15,430
You're holding a burger now.

2794
01:55:16,610 --> 01:55:17,610
Where should I go?

2795
01:55:17,730 --> 01:55:18,290
This way?

2796
01:55:18,610 --> 01:55:19,210
Senpai Pekora!

2797
01:55:19,210 --> 01:55:19,750
There's no plate.

2798
01:55:20,710 --> 01:55:21,630
There's no plate.

2799
01:55:21,770 --> 01:55:23,690
Looks like we're out of plates.

2800
01:55:23,730 --> 01:55:24,840
You're holding it now.

2801
01:55:24,840 --> 01:55:25,410
You're holding it now.

2802
01:55:26,130 --> 01:55:26,840
Not holding it.

2803
01:55:26,840 --> 01:55:27,190
Not holding it.

2804
01:55:28,130 --> 01:55:29,690
Senpai Pekora just spoke.

2805
01:55:30,600 --> 01:55:31,620
Up! Senpai Pekora, up!

2806
01:55:31,620 --> 01:55:31,740
Up!

2807
01:55:31,740 --> 01:55:31,850
Up!

2808
01:55:31,850 --> 01:55:32,370
Up!

2809
01:55:32,370 --> 01:55:32,980
Up!

2810
01:55:33,160 --> 01:55:33,769
This one.

2811
01:55:33,769 --> 01:55:34,260
This guy.

2812
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:36,400
Dirty plate.

2813
01:55:36,400 --> 01:55:36,920
Dirty plate.

2814
01:55:36,980 --> 01:55:38,440
This is a dirty plate.

2815
01:55:40,120 --> 01:55:41,820
Sou-chan, are you okay?

2816
01:55:41,820 --> 01:55:43,440
This is kinda tough.

2817
01:55:43,740 --> 01:55:45,100
Oh no!

2818
01:55:45,440 --> 01:55:45,800
Ah—

2819
01:55:48,910 --> 01:55:49,950
Ahahahaha!

2820
01:55:51,040 --> 01:55:53,320
Busy, huh? Why?

2821
01:55:53,320 --> 01:55:55,680
Why did it turn out like this?

2822
01:55:56,239 --> 01:55:57,040
Why, Pekora?

2823
01:55:57,040 --> 01:55:59,420
Why has my world line diverged so much from everyone else’s already?

2824
01:55:59,420 --> 01:55:59,640
This...

2825
01:56:00,940 --> 01:56:02,280
But why though?

2826
01:56:04,010 --> 01:56:05,270
Maybe this happened because...

2827
01:56:05,270 --> 01:56:05,970
It fell,

2828
01:56:05,970 --> 01:56:08,850
so maybe things got a bit worse again?

2829
01:56:09,650 --> 01:56:10,590
Yeah, maybe that's it.

2830
01:56:11,730 --> 01:56:12,450
Like this...

2831
01:56:12,450 --> 01:56:13,990
Ah, we don't need the dishwasher!

2832
01:56:13,990 --> 01:56:14,690
Ah, the dishwasher!

2833
01:56:15,510 --> 01:56:17,910
No no, I want to power sink.

2834
01:56:17,910 --> 01:56:19,150
Akki!

2835
01:56:22,510 --> 01:56:23,150
I'll let them know.

2836
01:56:23,150 --> 01:56:23,930
To Senpai Pekoro.

2837
01:56:25,210 --> 01:56:26,430
Pekora, you know...

2838
01:56:26,430 --> 01:56:28,530
Has the waitress gotten worse?

2839
01:56:28,530 --> 01:56:30,190
I wonder if Sou-chan's burden is okay.

2840
01:56:30,190 --> 01:56:31,289
That’d be insane, right?

2841
01:56:32,020 --> 01:56:32,880
It's fine!

2842
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:34,320
Senpai Pekoro, you're holding it, holding it!

2843
01:56:34,320 --> 01:56:35,540
Senpai Pekoro, put that down below.

2844
01:56:35,540 --> 01:56:37,100
You're holding this, yes, holding it, holding it!

2845
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:39,860
You handed it over.

2846
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:40,320
Delivered!

2847
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:40,700
Delivered!

2848
01:56:41,120 --> 01:56:43,080
Ah—I gave it; you're not holding this anymore.

2849
01:56:43,080 --> 01:56:43,800
But you've been holding it the whole time...

2850
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:44,800
Pekora, like, burgers and stuff...

2851
01:56:45,360 --> 01:56:47,220
You managed to hand it over—you’re giving it now!

2852
01:56:48,500 --> 01:56:49,620
Hold it once more.

2853
01:56:49,620 --> 01:56:50,859
Hold it again, Senpai Pekoro!

2854
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:52,179
Holding it, holding it!

2855
01:56:52,179 --> 01:56:53,740
Please give it to just one person.

2856
01:56:53,740 --> 01:56:56,460
One person hasn’t come yet, hasn’t come!

2857
01:56:56,460 --> 01:56:58,300
Here, here—top left!

2858
01:56:58,300 --> 01:57:00,480
Top left, top left—is it here?

2859
01:57:01,560 --> 01:57:02,200
Right here.

2860
01:57:02,720 --> 01:57:06,220
You're handing it over—perfect!

2861
01:57:06,220 --> 01:57:06,780
Senpai Pekuro!

2862
01:57:07,280 --> 01:57:08,260
You took the burger.

2863
01:57:08,640 --> 01:57:09,280
Not holding it.

2864
01:57:10,280 --> 01:57:11,740
Not holding it, not holding it.

2865
01:57:12,840 --> 01:57:14,280
This is Burger-senpai.

2866
01:57:14,280 --> 01:57:17,820
I want you to hand it over right there, right there, right there, right there.

2867
01:57:17,820 --> 01:57:18,560
Here, okay?

2868
01:57:18,560 --> 01:57:19,860
I handed it over, right there, right there, right there.

2869
01:57:20,020 --> 01:57:21,240
It's handed over, handed over, perfect!

2870
01:57:21,240 --> 01:57:22,520
Perfect! Okay, okay, okay!

2871
01:57:22,520 --> 01:57:22,880
Good, good, good!

2872
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:24,760
Our communication streak is getting really impressive.

2873
01:57:25,140 --> 01:57:26,100
I took this burger.

2874
01:57:26,260 --> 01:57:26,760
Can't hold it.

2875
01:57:27,620 --> 01:57:28,320
Do your best!

2876
01:57:29,800 --> 01:57:30,680
I took this.

2877
01:57:31,180 --> 01:57:32,880
Already holding a plate—plate, dish!

2878
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:34,740
That's a plate, yeah! Yay!

2879
01:57:35,810 --> 01:57:36,790
What is this? I want to do it!

2880
01:57:39,290 --> 01:57:40,090
Can't proceed.

2881
01:57:40,770 --> 01:57:42,350
Can't proceed from Day-san.

2882
01:57:42,350 --> 01:57:42,370
Huh? Why?

2883
01:57:42,950 --> 01:57:45,030
Ah, is it just one person? Or maybe that...

2884
01:57:45,030 --> 01:57:46,510
Though there actually weren't that many people.

2885
01:57:46,510 --> 01:57:46,630
Now...

2886
01:57:47,110 --> 01:57:49,290
Wait, the game isn't over yet, right?

2887
01:57:49,450 --> 01:57:50,310
It's over.

2888
01:57:50,470 --> 01:57:51,570
But it's not over yet.

2889
01:57:52,230 --> 01:57:54,140
Ah, but we still have time.

2890
01:57:54,140 --> 01:57:55,250
We still have 2 minutes and 40 seconds left.

2891
01:57:56,030 --> 01:57:57,080
No, that's not what I meant.

2892
01:57:57,080 --> 01:57:58,910
I meant, we're still making burgers, right?

2893
01:57:59,230 --> 01:57:59,590
We're not making any.

2894
01:58:01,330 --> 01:58:02,430
Pekora-senpai, it's over.

2895
01:58:02,430 --> 01:58:02,670
Right now?

2896
01:58:02,990 --> 01:58:03,850
That part is finished.

2897
01:58:04,190 --> 01:58:05,990
Pekora, you're delivering burgers right now.

2898
01:58:06,370 --> 01:58:07,050
Burgers.

2899
01:58:07,110 --> 01:58:08,510
The ones on the table—the kitchen ones.

2900
01:58:09,250 --> 01:58:10,390
Where should I take it?

2901
01:58:10,390 --> 01:58:12,170
But I feel like I'm supposed to be holding a task item or something.

2902
01:58:12,510 --> 01:58:13,210
You're not holding anything.

2903
01:58:13,650 --> 01:58:15,090
Pekora, it's not over yet.

2904
01:58:15,169 --> 01:58:16,510
There's no such thing as game over.

2905
01:58:16,510 --> 01:58:17,580
There's no such thing as game over.

2906
01:58:19,340 --> 01:58:21,300
World War is quite different, actually.

2907
01:58:23,490 --> 01:58:26,490
Pekura-senpai left me behind.

2908
01:58:27,570 --> 01:58:30,390
We lost just now—it reset.

2909
01:58:30,390 --> 01:58:31,570
It's super slow.

2910
01:58:34,420 --> 01:58:37,660
Feels like a significant delay.

2911
01:58:38,419 --> 01:58:40,040
This is bad, seriously.

2912
01:58:40,040 --> 01:58:41,720
Yeah, this is kinda bad.

2913
01:58:43,470 --> 01:58:44,390
Seriously, just a bit...

2914
01:58:44,390 --> 01:58:45,470
We should probably re-invite them.

2915
01:58:45,470 --> 01:58:47,230
But this is really bad.

2916
01:58:48,570 --> 01:58:52,100
At this point, maybe we should leave once and...

2917
01:58:52,100 --> 01:58:55,330
...get re-invited back in?

2918
01:58:55,330 --> 01:58:56,210
Goodbye.

2919
01:58:57,230 --> 01:59:00,890
Can you re-invite someone while the game is already started?

2920
01:59:00,890 --> 01:59:01,730
Didn't you say earlier...

2921
01:59:01,730 --> 01:59:03,530
Was it re-invite after the game started?

2922
01:59:04,490 --> 01:59:05,810
Pekari-senpai, you're holding it now, holding it!

2923
01:59:05,810 --> 01:59:06,090
Holding it!

2924
01:59:06,430 --> 01:59:07,330
Went downstairs, downstairs!

2925
01:59:07,330 --> 01:59:08,630
Nice! Nice!

2926
01:59:08,669 --> 01:59:10,390
In situations this bad...

2927
01:59:10,390 --> 01:59:12,470
...you really should just rejoin the room.

2928
01:59:13,170 --> 01:59:15,090
Probably, ultimately...

2929
01:59:15,470 --> 01:59:16,660
Pekora-senpai, can you hold that?

2930
01:59:16,660 --> 01:59:18,770
Alright, got it!

2931
01:59:19,810 --> 01:59:21,490
That's pretty nice, right there!

2932
01:59:22,349 --> 01:59:25,290
Placed it, placed it—perfect!

2933
01:59:25,290 --> 01:59:25,770
Perfect!

2934
01:59:27,420 --> 01:59:29,480
If a burger appears in front of Pekora...

2935
01:59:29,480 --> 01:59:29,820
...let me know.

2936
01:59:29,820 --> 01:59:31,140
Can hold it now.

2937
01:59:31,140 --> 01:59:32,140
Can hold it now.

2938
01:59:36,770 --> 01:59:38,010
Multitasking!

2939
01:59:38,010 --> 01:59:40,820
Wow, Pekora's amazing at this!

2940
01:59:40,820 --> 01:59:43,120
If there's a burger here, tell Pekora—it's right in front of her.

2941
01:59:43,120 --> 01:59:43,569
Not yet.

2942
01:59:43,569 --> 01:59:44,480
Wait, Pekora-senpai!

2943
01:59:44,480 --> 01:59:45,520
The plate—

2944
01:59:45,900 --> 01:59:46,180
Yes!

2945
01:59:46,180 --> 01:59:47,340
It's fine now—I've got it!

2946
01:59:47,340 --> 01:59:47,700
Got it now!

2947
01:59:49,060 --> 01:59:49,770
Downstairs—ah!

2948
01:59:49,770 --> 01:59:50,200
Downstairs.

2949
01:59:51,020 --> 01:59:51,750
Ah, but...

2950
01:59:51,750 --> 01:59:52,480
Already handed it over.

2951
01:59:52,900 --> 01:59:54,480
Over here

2952
01:59:55,140 --> 01:59:55,420
Now

2953
01:59:56,270 --> 01:59:57,090
I went, I went

2954
01:59:57,090 --> 01:59:57,350
I went

2955
01:59:58,210 --> 01:59:59,070
Perfect!

2956
02:00:02,120 --> 02:00:03,110
Good, good

2957
02:00:03,110 --> 02:00:03,360
Good

2958
02:00:03,880 --> 02:00:05,170
Ah, you can hold it, you can hold it, Senpai Pekora

2959
02:00:05,170 --> 02:00:05,340
Now

2960
02:00:05,980 --> 02:00:06,420
You can hold it

2961
02:00:06,660 --> 02:00:07,800
Uh-uh, can't hold it

2962
02:00:08,120 --> 02:00:08,639
You can hold it

2963
02:00:09,400 --> 02:00:10,110
You can hold it, right?

2964
02:00:10,110 --> 02:00:10,240
OK

2965
02:00:10,520 --> 02:00:11,930
I'll hold it—I held it

2966
02:00:11,930 --> 02:00:12,440
Probably

2967
02:00:13,780 --> 02:00:14,900
Around here

2968
02:00:14,900 --> 02:00:15,620
It's being placed

2969
02:00:16,900 --> 02:00:17,720
Nice, nice

2970
02:00:17,720 --> 02:00:19,280
Are you moving based on future prediction?

2971
02:00:19,280 --> 02:00:19,940
That's insane

2972
02:00:20,120 --> 02:00:21,260
You can hold it

2973
02:00:21,260 --> 02:00:21,560
You can hold it

2974
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:25,420
These two

2975
02:00:26,100 --> 02:00:27,300
It's fine to place it

2976
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:28,000
Placed it

2977
02:00:29,580 --> 02:00:30,600
Can hold it now

2978
02:00:31,440 --> 02:00:31,840
Up

2979
02:00:33,700 --> 02:00:34,640
Nice!

2980
02:00:36,160 --> 02:00:37,520
The timer just rang

2981
02:00:38,910 --> 02:00:39,430
Where?

2982
02:00:42,310 --> 02:00:43,730
15 minutes over

2983
02:00:43,730 --> 02:00:47,410
But if there were no lag, that'd be right

2984
02:00:47,410 --> 02:00:48,450
If there were no lag

2985
02:00:48,450 --> 02:00:49,310
Pekora and the others could make it

2986
02:00:49,310 --> 02:00:51,370
Pekora and the others, go down—right now, down

2987
02:00:52,150 --> 02:00:54,730
Not there, to the right of that—over here

2988
02:00:55,430 --> 02:00:58,810
But we can place it, we can place it

2989
02:01:00,080 --> 02:01:05,720
Kani

2990
02:01:05,720 --> 02:01:06,600
Suu-chan's

2991
02:01:07,660 --> 02:01:10,720
If you peek at Suu-chan's screen showing the threat, Pekora could do it, right?

2992
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:14,280
Not by myself

2993
02:01:14,280 --> 02:01:17,960
Suu-chan's screen sharing

2994
02:01:17,960 --> 02:01:22,010
Maybe we can manage if we look at the screen share

2995
02:01:22,010 --> 02:01:23,050
We're doing it right now

2996
02:01:23,870 --> 02:01:26,730
Pekora's game isn't over yet

2997
02:01:26,730 --> 02:01:27,750
Sales figures haven't shown up either

2998
02:01:27,750 --> 02:01:28,630
But when looking at Suu-chan's screen

2999
02:01:28,630 --> 02:01:30,370
The sales numbers are showing up big time

3000
02:01:30,370 --> 02:01:31,430
Yeah, it's definitely over now

3001
02:01:31,430 --> 02:01:32,890
By the way, it's

3002
02:01:32,890 --> 02:01:33,930
Alright to relax now

3003
02:01:34,530 --> 02:01:35,250
Yeah, OK

3004
02:01:39,250 --> 02:01:41,910
But let's reset the timer once more

3005
02:01:41,910 --> 02:01:42,490
Start it from the beginning

3006
02:01:42,490 --> 02:01:43,710
And redo the room too

3007
02:01:43,710 --> 02:01:45,050
Shall we rebuild it?

3008
02:01:45,050 --> 02:01:49,510
Hopefully Senpai Pekora's lag gets fixed too. Yeah, OK

3009
02:01:50,710 --> 02:01:51,690
Then let's go back

3010
02:01:52,970 --> 02:01:55,350
Safe & Return or Abandon—

3011
02:01:56,770 --> 02:02:01,130
Safe & Return, let's do this once

3012
02:02:01,130 --> 02:02:03,910
Pekora will restart the game. Okay!

3013
02:02:04,550 --> 02:02:05,430
Okay!

3014
02:02:07,240 --> 02:02:07,740
Huh? Huh?

3015
02:02:08,460 --> 02:02:11,080
Plate upgrades happening so often it's ridiculous

3016
02:02:11,080 --> 02:02:11,500
Restarting

3017
02:02:11,500 --> 02:02:15,450
Why is the lag so bad though?

3018
02:02:16,610 --> 02:02:17,290
Hey

3019
02:02:17,290 --> 02:02:18,890
It's weird

3020
02:02:21,120 --> 02:02:22,920
Ah, level 6

3021
02:02:23,780 --> 02:02:24,300
Or not?

3022
02:02:24,300 --> 02:02:27,000
Ah, this is probably Senpai Kiara's level

3023
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:27,570
Kiara-san

3024
02:02:27,570 --> 02:02:28,600
Seriously, Senpai Risu?

3025
02:02:29,480 --> 02:02:29,870
Yeah

3026
02:02:29,870 --> 02:02:31,240
Yeah yeah yeah, Risu-chan

3027
02:02:31,240 --> 02:02:32,860
Call me once more

3028
02:02:33,680 --> 02:02:34,000
Yes

3029
02:02:38,420 --> 02:02:40,560
Alright, thanks, Banger

3030
02:02:41,420 --> 02:02:42,440
Like this, then

3031
02:02:47,600 --> 02:02:51,100
Hope this fixes things

3032
02:02:51,100 --> 02:02:53,560
Sometimes there's no lag

3033
02:02:53,560 --> 02:02:55,540
But sometimes it suddenly gets heavy

3034
02:02:55,540 --> 02:02:56,679
How strange

3035
02:03:01,590 --> 02:03:04,410
Feels like it popped up due to a seed value

3036
02:03:04,410 --> 02:03:04,630
This

3037
02:03:05,170 --> 02:03:06,630
Pecoland Brazil

3038
02:03:08,410 --> 02:03:11,130
Maybe they really are on the other side

3039
02:03:11,170 --> 02:03:12,750
Huh, none of them are here

3040
02:03:12,750 --> 02:03:15,110
Isn't this supposed to be a four-person room? Huh?

3041
02:03:15,610 --> 02:03:18,070
Maybe it'd be better if you called me once again, huh? Yeah, okay.

3042
02:03:18,670 --> 02:03:20,430
Hey, sorry, could you call me once more?

3043
02:03:21,230 --> 02:03:21,870
Yeees!

3044
02:03:23,180 --> 02:03:23,900
Thank youuu!

3045
02:03:25,030 --> 02:03:26,330
Will this work to get in?

3046
02:03:31,740 --> 02:03:32,140
Huh?

3047
02:03:32,140 --> 02:03:32,720
It won't go in.

3048
02:03:35,410 --> 02:03:36,770
It's pitch black in here.

3049
02:03:37,010 --> 02:03:37,690
No way!

3050
02:03:39,050 --> 02:03:40,270
Oh no no no no!

3051
02:03:41,390 --> 02:03:43,450
Should we rebuild the entire room?

3052
02:03:43,450 --> 02:03:43,750
For now...

3053
02:03:46,100 --> 02:03:47,230
Ah, Risu!

3054
02:03:47,230 --> 02:03:49,930
It might as well be a completely new room. Yeah, yeah.

3055
02:03:49,930 --> 02:03:51,600
Maybe it's better to do it room by room.

3056
02:03:51,600 --> 02:03:54,110
Okay!

3057
02:03:54,110 --> 02:03:54,910
Okay!

3058
02:03:54,910 --> 02:03:55,510
Wait a sec—!

3059
02:03:56,050 --> 02:03:56,330
Thank you!

3060
02:04:00,650 --> 02:04:04,860
I wonder how high the level will go.

3061
02:04:07,250 --> 02:04:08,490
Level...

3062
02:04:08,490 --> 02:04:11,590
Still only level 3, still level 3... Man, that's slow.

3063
02:04:13,660 --> 02:04:15,400
Just how much more do I have to do?

3064
02:04:16,310 --> 02:04:17,650
Still only level 3...

3065
02:04:19,460 --> 02:04:19,940
With this...

3066
02:04:23,870 --> 02:04:25,790
I'll go think about it.

3067
02:04:26,270 --> 02:04:26,750
Thank you very much!

3068
02:04:26,750 --> 02:04:28,050
Thanks a lot!

3069
02:04:28,970 --> 02:04:30,110
Please do your best!

3070
02:04:32,500 --> 02:04:35,210
That would really help. Well, that's about it for now.

3071
02:04:35,210 --> 02:04:36,180
Pekora-senpai...

3072
02:04:37,020 --> 02:04:39,840
For this year's soccer World Cup...

3073
02:04:39,840 --> 02:04:41,620
Are you rooting for Argentina?

3074
02:04:42,710 --> 02:04:43,150
Nah...

3075
02:04:43,150 --> 02:04:45,250
I'm also supporting Japan, but still...

3076
02:04:45,890 --> 02:04:48,860
Argentiiina...

3077
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:52,370
I wonder what'll happen.

3078
02:04:52,370 --> 02:04:53,800
But still, go Japan!

3079
02:04:55,100 --> 02:04:56,320
Yeah, that's true, but...

3080
02:04:56,320 --> 02:04:59,600
Austria's group this time...

3081
02:04:59,619 --> 02:05:03,940
Their first opponent is Argentina, actually.

3082
02:05:03,940 --> 02:05:05,140
Oh, really?

3083
02:05:05,820 --> 02:05:08,160
I'm scared... I hope Austria wins, though.

3084
02:05:08,160 --> 02:05:10,400
I might need you to call me again.

3085
02:05:10,400 --> 02:05:12,760
Guess I should just leave once... Oh no, bad idea!

3086
02:05:12,760 --> 02:05:17,520
The color alone is scary like this.

3087
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:21,700
Argentina won the last tournament, right?

3088
02:05:21,700 --> 02:05:22,480
If I recall correctly...

3089
02:05:23,860 --> 02:05:24,190
Hmm...

3090
02:05:24,190 --> 02:05:24,860
They're way too good.

3091
02:05:26,100 --> 02:05:27,280
Is Japan's team any good?

3092
02:05:28,740 --> 02:05:30,260
If only Japan were good enough...

3093
02:05:30,260 --> 02:05:32,990
I really don't wanna face Argentina.

3094
02:05:32,990 --> 02:05:33,660
Honestly speaking...

3095
02:05:34,200 --> 02:05:34,850
Right?

3096
02:05:34,850 --> 02:05:35,740
Everyone feels that way.

3097
02:05:37,100 --> 02:05:37,720
Good, good.

3098
02:05:38,140 --> 02:05:38,800
Ah!

3099
02:05:39,399 --> 02:05:39,899
Oops!

3100
02:05:39,899 --> 02:05:40,680
Let's change the color.

3101
02:05:41,970 --> 02:05:43,430
Huh, is this already looking good?

3102
02:05:43,430 --> 02:05:43,830
This...

3103
02:05:45,470 --> 02:05:46,330
Is it lagging?

3104
02:05:47,110 --> 02:05:48,830
I wonder if this room won't lag.

3105
02:05:50,400 --> 02:05:53,320
Everyone, please read my misunderstanding~!

3106
02:05:54,100 --> 02:05:54,500
Yes!

3107
02:05:58,820 --> 02:06:02,240
Injury... Are Japanese team members injured?

3108
02:06:02,640 --> 02:06:03,340
Yeah, yeah!

3109
02:06:03,340 --> 02:06:05,300
Seems like quite a few are injured.

3110
02:06:05,300 --> 02:06:06,720
Is this bad? If...

3111
02:06:06,720 --> 02:06:08,560
What if they don't heal? They will heal.

3112
02:06:09,200 --> 02:06:10,100
By then...

3113
02:06:10,620 --> 02:06:12,280
I hope they recover in time.

3114
02:06:15,070 --> 02:06:19,030
Who's the best player on the Japanese national team?

3115
02:06:19,950 --> 02:06:20,690
Who is it?

3116
02:06:20,690 --> 02:06:22,330
I think they're all really good.

3117
02:06:22,330 --> 02:06:23,520
Still...

3118
02:06:23,520 --> 02:06:24,210
But...

3119
02:06:24,210 --> 02:06:26,010
Watching soccer, especially Pe-kola, I always think...

3120
02:06:26,010 --> 02:06:28,190
I never want to be a goalkeeper.

3121
02:06:28,190 --> 02:06:31,480
The pressure from the press is just too intense.

3122
02:06:31,480 --> 02:06:35,260
Yeah, exactly—it's a huge responsibility too.

3123
02:06:35,260 --> 02:06:36,930
Whether or not you can stop it...

3124
02:06:36,930 --> 02:06:37,830
If you can't stop it...

3125
02:06:37,830 --> 02:06:41,070
That directly leads to conceding a goal.

3126
02:06:41,550 --> 02:06:43,770
Every single time with the goalkeeper...

3127
02:06:43,770 --> 02:06:46,360
I always end up watching while thinking, 'You can do it!'

3128
02:06:46,360 --> 02:06:46,830
Honestly...

3129
02:06:47,250 --> 02:06:51,410
Hey, um... whoa, wait, Pekora!

3130
02:06:51,410 --> 02:06:53,450
It's starting to lag from this point onward.

3131
02:06:53,450 --> 02:06:55,520
Movement-wise, is everyone okay?

3132
02:06:55,520 --> 02:06:59,470
Worst case, should we screen-share?

3133
02:06:59,490 --> 02:07:00,910
Yeah, worst case.

3134
02:07:00,910 --> 02:07:01,970
I'll screen-share.

3135
02:07:05,240 --> 02:07:06,620
Might not be working.

3136
02:07:15,220 --> 02:07:16,900
Huh? Were you already in the room?

3137
02:07:17,120 --> 02:07:17,660
Kubo?

3138
02:07:18,200 --> 02:07:19,440
Just joined now.

3139
02:07:20,260 --> 02:07:20,840
Seriously?

3140
02:07:22,080 --> 02:07:26,740
Then let's start the 15 minutes now.

3141
02:07:26,800 --> 02:07:29,520
Ah, starting right now, got it.

3142
02:07:30,360 --> 02:07:30,940
Start!

3143
02:07:31,660 --> 02:07:32,020
Alright,

3144
02:07:32,020 --> 02:07:32,860
Please handle the reservation desk.

3145
02:07:34,260 --> 02:07:35,220
And this...

3146
02:07:39,990 --> 02:07:40,350
Huh?

3147
02:07:40,350 --> 02:07:41,810
Suu-chan's handling it for us.

3148
02:07:47,260 --> 02:07:48,510
OK, nice! Just like this.

3149
02:07:48,510 --> 02:07:49,540
Shinku!

3150
02:07:51,560 --> 02:07:53,520
The door's hard to see. Wasn't it here?

3151
02:07:53,520 --> 02:07:54,400
Was it here?

3152
02:07:57,000 --> 02:08:00,180
I think it was this end and that end. OK.

3153
02:08:00,180 --> 02:08:01,600
Then this spot should be fine.

3154
02:08:09,220 --> 02:08:10,020
Oh no!

3155
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:14,700
It's already lagging before we even started—no way!

3156
02:08:16,530 --> 02:08:17,450
Done!

3157
02:08:17,450 --> 02:08:21,630
Seriously, let's get the Japanese members to make a hair conditioner.

3158
02:08:23,370 --> 02:08:23,600
Yeah, true.

3159
02:08:23,600 --> 02:08:25,630
Might not be possible today, though.

3160
02:08:27,170 --> 02:08:28,630
Okay, let's go!

3161
02:08:29,250 --> 02:08:31,050
Let's do this!

3162
02:08:32,910 --> 02:08:33,310
Yes.

3163
02:08:33,310 --> 02:08:33,950
I'm fine.

3164
02:08:34,770 --> 02:08:36,070
Let's start.

3165
02:08:37,210 --> 02:08:38,870
Please go ahead with the reservation!

3166
02:08:41,770 --> 02:08:42,570
Actually,

3167
02:08:42,570 --> 02:08:43,950
It might be better to watch Suu-chan's screen,

3168
02:08:43,950 --> 02:08:45,530
Feels like it's still a few seconds too early.

3169
02:08:49,540 --> 02:08:50,180
In that case,

3170
02:08:52,040 --> 02:08:52,440
Hair...

3171
02:08:53,240 --> 02:08:55,140
Thanks, seems like it's around here.

3172
02:08:55,420 --> 02:08:56,840
Ah, I have it now, I have it now!

3173
02:08:57,510 --> 02:08:58,630
Ah, I can hand it over now!

3174
02:09:02,430 --> 02:09:03,350
I have it now.

3175
02:09:07,380 --> 02:09:08,400
It's working out!

3176
02:09:09,870 --> 02:09:11,310
Ah, different face now.

3177
02:09:14,130 --> 02:09:14,710
Heave-ho!

3178
02:09:15,030 --> 02:09:15,650
Ah, that one's on top!

3179
02:09:15,650 --> 02:09:16,250
Pekora-san, the top one!

3180
02:09:17,430 --> 02:09:18,150
OK, OK!

3181
02:09:18,150 --> 02:09:19,350
Please give it to just one person.

3182
02:09:19,350 --> 02:09:20,090
Ah, OK!

3183
02:09:20,090 --> 02:09:21,250
Ah, sorry, sorry, sorry!

3184
02:09:21,250 --> 02:09:22,070
It's totally fine!

3185
02:09:23,639 --> 02:09:26,380
Ah, with Pekora's thing, just one person...

3186
02:09:27,340 --> 02:09:28,900
Ah, that one has no plate.

3187
02:09:31,750 --> 02:09:33,190
Please spare me already!

3188
02:09:34,550 --> 02:09:35,950
I can't do anything!

3189
02:09:35,950 --> 02:09:38,330
I'm alright, Daikan-senpai!

3190
02:09:38,330 --> 02:09:38,730
I'm holding that.

3191
02:09:39,580 --> 02:09:41,180
Ah, I'm holding the hamburger now.

3192
02:09:41,180 --> 02:09:41,820
Ah, that one has no plate.

3193
02:09:44,300 --> 02:09:46,100
This is getting bad!

3194
02:09:47,770 --> 02:09:49,210
Don't think it's sour!

3195
02:09:49,210 --> 02:09:49,970
I can hold that.

3196
02:09:49,970 --> 02:09:50,470
I can hold that.

3197
02:09:50,950 --> 02:09:54,480
That edge, edge, edge—ah, OK!

3198
02:09:55,180 --> 02:09:55,920
This is kinda bad.

3199
02:09:58,470 --> 02:09:59,910
I'm not even a spy!

3200
02:09:59,910 --> 02:10:03,050
Pekora's seriously going all out!

3201
02:10:03,570 --> 02:10:05,710
There are no customers right now, Pekora-senpai.

3202
02:10:05,710 --> 02:10:06,430
Nope, none.

3203
02:10:06,430 --> 02:10:06,710
OK.

3204
02:10:06,710 --> 02:10:07,170
OK.

3205
02:10:07,170 --> 02:10:08,190
OK.

3206
02:10:08,190 --> 02:10:09,050
OK, OK!

3207
02:10:09,050 --> 02:10:09,370
OK.

3208
02:10:12,370 --> 02:10:13,670
I wonder why...

3209
02:10:14,190 --> 02:10:16,290
The first 30 minutes or so

3210
02:10:16,290 --> 02:10:17,929
were going really well,

3211
02:10:17,929 --> 02:10:21,550
but now it won't fix itself—that update...

3212
02:10:21,550 --> 02:10:22,450
Ah, it's showing up.

3213
02:10:22,450 --> 02:10:23,570
Showing up, this one.

3214
02:10:25,330 --> 02:10:26,670
The beginning's already over.

3215
02:10:26,670 --> 02:10:27,870
It's finished already.

3216
02:10:28,510 --> 02:10:30,650
Still working hard, though, Pekora.

3217
02:10:30,650 --> 02:10:33,250
It's definitely moving right now.

3218
02:10:33,250 --> 02:10:35,610
Amazing, Senpai Pekora!

3219
02:10:38,890 --> 02:10:40,790
Pekora's holding us back.

3220
02:10:40,790 --> 02:10:42,010
Even though I came on skates...

3221
02:10:42,010 --> 02:10:42,490
Well...

3222
02:10:43,709 --> 02:10:45,110
Right now, press Y.

3223
02:10:45,110 --> 02:10:46,610
Waiting for the start.

3224
02:10:47,290 --> 02:10:49,310
I'm pressing Y already—it's started!

3225
02:10:49,310 --> 02:10:49,830
It's started!

3226
02:10:49,830 --> 02:10:51,290
Senpai Pekora, what's going on right now?

3227
02:10:51,710 --> 02:10:53,510
She's still playing My Game.

3228
02:10:53,510 --> 02:10:54,430
Still on My Game.

3229
02:10:57,180 --> 02:10:59,060
I'll check Suu-chan's screen.

3230
02:11:04,140 --> 02:11:06,000
You're popular right now!

3231
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:06,580
Senpai Pekora...

3232
02:11:08,680 --> 02:11:10,400
If you don't move yourself...

3233
02:11:10,400 --> 02:11:13,340
It's impossible to tell how things are moving.

3234
02:11:25,890 --> 02:11:27,790
Oh no, I finally got into the game—

3235
02:11:27,790 --> 02:11:31,309
My Game ended, and everyone's rushing around getting ready!

3236
02:11:33,340 --> 02:11:34,019
Oh no!

3237
02:11:34,019 --> 02:11:35,559
This might be pretty slow.

3238
02:11:37,510 --> 02:11:39,930
Why am I stuck in this other dimension?

3239
02:11:39,930 --> 02:11:40,450
All by myself...

3240
02:11:41,480 --> 02:11:42,840
Why is only Senpai Pekora...

3241
02:11:42,840 --> 02:11:45,180
So far behind?

3242
02:11:46,140 --> 02:11:49,700
Hey, Suu-chan's support is getting really good!

3243
02:11:53,190 --> 02:11:54,590
Reliable!

3244
02:11:59,050 --> 02:12:00,270
Here it comes—

3245
02:12:02,150 --> 02:12:02,830
This way?

3246
02:12:05,130 --> 02:12:06,150
I need a plate.

3247
02:12:08,010 --> 02:12:08,350
Here you go.

3248
02:12:08,350 --> 02:12:08,870
Wait a sec—

3249
02:12:09,450 --> 02:12:10,310
Here it comes—

3250
02:12:11,150 --> 02:12:12,090
Buka-senpai, that one!

3251
02:12:12,090 --> 02:12:13,279
Put it there, please—right there!

3252
02:12:13,279 --> 02:12:14,310
Nice, nice, right here!

3253
02:12:14,810 --> 02:12:15,910
Ah, placed it, placed it!

3254
02:12:16,330 --> 02:12:16,970
Ah!

3255
02:12:24,470 --> 02:12:26,190
Buka-senpai, the bottom left one!

3256
02:12:27,270 --> 02:12:27,770
OK, okay!

3257
02:12:30,700 --> 02:12:31,400
Alrighty!

3258
02:12:32,110 --> 02:12:32,870
Luca, Shaba, bottom!

3259
02:12:33,590 --> 02:12:34,270
Alrighty!

3260
02:12:35,370 --> 02:12:35,690
Bottom!

3261
02:12:36,530 --> 02:12:36,850
Now!

3262
02:12:38,890 --> 02:12:39,530
This way!

3263
02:12:42,900 --> 02:12:44,260
That one, bottom right!

3264
02:12:44,260 --> 02:12:45,850
Please take it to the bottom right!

3265
02:12:45,850 --> 02:12:46,820
Okay, okay!

3266
02:12:46,820 --> 02:12:47,540
Okay, okay, okay!

3267
02:12:47,540 --> 02:12:48,180
Good, good!

3268
02:12:48,180 --> 02:12:49,340
Great! Got it!

3269
02:12:50,530 --> 02:12:51,070
Oh!

3270
02:12:54,960 --> 02:12:55,380
Then...

3271
02:12:56,940 --> 02:12:57,660
Perfect!

3272
02:12:59,900 --> 02:13:01,970
Clearing now—waiting for the A button!

3273
02:13:01,970 --> 02:13:04,800
Senpai Pekora's still in the middle of it, but...

3274
02:13:04,800 --> 02:13:05,700
Pressed the A button!

3275
02:13:05,700 --> 02:13:06,140
Thank you!

3276
02:13:07,020 --> 02:13:08,420
Exiting—brush brush!

3277
02:13:09,020 --> 02:13:10,140
Oh, please,

3278
02:13:10,260 --> 02:13:11,980
My beloved brush!

3279
02:13:12,620 --> 02:13:14,240
Seriously, why was only Pekora...

3280
02:13:14,240 --> 02:13:16,080
So far ahead? Alright!

3281
02:13:19,650 --> 02:13:20,010
OK!

3282
02:13:22,090 --> 02:13:23,090
Brush!

3283
02:13:24,430 --> 02:13:25,550
What did it become?

3284
02:13:25,550 --> 02:13:27,200
Oh, King Sink!

3285
02:13:27,200 --> 02:13:29,220
No, no, no, no—okay!

3286
02:13:29,220 --> 02:13:29,530
Next!

3287
02:13:29,910 --> 02:13:31,410
This one—okay from before!

3288
02:13:31,410 --> 02:13:31,670
Okay!

3289
02:13:31,670 --> 02:13:32,370
Okay, thank you!

3290
02:13:37,210 --> 02:13:37,990
Okay!

3291
02:13:38,530 --> 02:13:38,850
Ah!

3292
02:13:39,720 --> 02:13:41,400
I think I got the one I needed.

3293
02:13:42,200 --> 02:13:42,860
Ohhh!

3294
02:13:43,240 --> 02:13:45,920
Did it! Uh, leftmost!

3295
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:48,220
Leftmost, okay!

3296
02:13:49,110 --> 02:13:49,430
Thank you!

3297
02:13:51,950 --> 02:13:52,710
Mama-chan!

3298
02:13:52,710 --> 02:13:54,330
Pekora-tachi are like this, huh?

3299
02:13:54,330 --> 02:13:55,090
Even when lag happens,

3300
02:13:55,090 --> 02:13:57,070
They're learning they can still communicate like this.

3301
02:13:57,070 --> 02:13:59,190
Tetsuya-senpai, that one—bottom left, okay!

3302
02:13:59,190 --> 02:13:59,610
Bottom left, got it.

3303
02:14:02,040 --> 02:14:02,570
Alrighty!

3304
02:14:02,570 --> 02:14:03,040
Alrighty!

3305
02:14:04,520 --> 02:14:05,080
Ah, sorry!

3306
02:14:05,660 --> 02:14:06,860
Resolation is

3307
02:14:08,480 --> 02:14:09,330
yoisho, yoisho

3308
02:14:09,330 --> 02:14:09,540
yoisho

3309
02:14:13,790 --> 02:14:14,540
OK

3310
02:14:14,540 --> 02:14:15,390
OK

3311
02:14:16,270 --> 02:14:16,950
Nice!

3312
02:14:17,910 --> 02:14:18,590
Forgot the brush

3313
02:14:20,950 --> 02:14:21,550
Brush

3314
02:14:21,550 --> 02:14:23,749
Forgot to use the brush, the brush

3315
02:14:23,749 --> 02:14:24,390
Do your best

3316
02:14:24,550 --> 02:14:25,070
Brush

3317
02:14:25,070 --> 02:14:26,260
There was a brush

3318
02:14:26,260 --> 02:14:26,610
There was

3319
02:14:27,470 --> 02:14:28,230
Nice!

3320
02:14:28,230 --> 02:14:28,810
Senpai Pekori

3321
02:14:29,450 --> 02:14:30,170
OK, OK

3322
02:14:30,170 --> 02:14:30,370
OK

3323
02:14:30,370 --> 02:14:32,010
While watching Suu-chan's screen share

3324
02:14:32,010 --> 02:14:34,070
I'm looking at the future world, so do your best

3325
02:14:41,250 --> 02:14:43,210
Luca Sebasle top-left

3326
02:14:44,410 --> 02:14:45,250
Top-left, right

3327
02:14:45,830 --> 02:14:46,410
This one, go ahead

3328
02:14:46,410 --> 02:14:48,010
There was one in Flash Brazil

3329
02:14:52,950 --> 02:14:53,890
Yes, I can hold it

3330
02:14:54,490 --> 02:14:55,350
That one, bottom-right

3331
02:14:56,070 --> 02:14:56,630
OK

3332
02:14:59,640 --> 02:15:00,580
Feeling good, feeling good

3333
02:15:04,710 --> 02:15:06,390
Luca Sebasle bottom-left

3334
02:15:07,790 --> 02:15:08,170
Nice!

3335
02:15:08,660 --> 02:15:09,300
OK

3336
02:15:09,300 --> 02:15:09,540
OK

3337
02:15:09,540 --> 02:15:09,840
OK

3338
02:15:15,900 --> 02:15:17,190
Here you go

3339
02:15:18,520 --> 02:15:18,920
Also

3340
02:15:18,920 --> 02:15:20,280
Only top-left, so

3341
02:15:20,280 --> 02:15:21,500
Ah, it hasn't arrived yet

3342
02:15:21,500 --> 02:15:23,320
Okay with Senpai Pekora

3343
02:15:25,500 --> 02:15:26,260
It came

3344
02:15:26,980 --> 02:15:27,700
OK

3345
02:15:28,080 --> 02:15:29,100
Well then

3346
02:15:30,359 --> 02:15:32,720
Right now, I can still hold it with the one below

3347
02:15:33,260 --> 02:15:34,160
Maybe one below

3348
02:15:34,320 --> 02:15:36,220
The one below—ah, yes

3349
02:15:36,420 --> 02:15:36,820
Here

3350
02:15:37,080 --> 02:15:37,480
Ah

3351
02:15:38,300 --> 02:15:38,900
In the back

3352
02:15:39,480 --> 02:15:40,080
Oh

3353
02:15:40,080 --> 02:15:41,200
OK

3354
02:15:41,200 --> 02:15:45,000
Good, using Pekoro like that is also great

3355
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:46,460
You're getting better

3356
02:15:46,460 --> 02:15:47,820
You're doing well

3357
02:15:49,160 --> 02:15:51,600
Even in moments like this, it's a bit reassuring

3358
02:15:51,600 --> 02:15:54,260
And we got 4—nice!

3359
02:15:56,800 --> 02:16:01,020
Right now, they're using Eg-Pekoro really well

3360
02:16:01,160 --> 02:16:02,140
Yeah, but

3361
02:16:02,140 --> 02:16:03,540
You're actually doing quite well

3362
02:16:04,270 --> 02:16:05,770
Now, it's either right or left

3363
02:16:05,770 --> 02:16:06,330
Senpai Pekoro

3364
02:16:06,870 --> 02:16:08,190
Right or left—please go right

3365
02:16:08,190 --> 02:16:08,990
I'll wait—okay!

3366
02:16:09,770 --> 02:16:10,510
So

3367
02:16:11,449 --> 02:16:12,190
This is

3368
02:16:12,290 --> 02:16:12,870
Power

3369
02:16:14,250 --> 02:16:15,010
Braits

3370
02:16:15,010 --> 02:16:15,370
Braits

3371
02:16:15,970 --> 02:16:17,230
Braits

3372
02:16:17,270 --> 02:16:18,250
They're holding something

3373
02:16:19,070 --> 02:16:19,680
What

3374
02:16:19,680 --> 02:16:19,990
What

3375
02:16:19,990 --> 02:16:21,330
Please place that with X

3376
02:16:21,330 --> 02:16:21,870
Somewhere

3377
02:16:23,340 --> 02:16:24,440
X or A

3378
02:16:26,380 --> 02:16:26,820
Thank you very much

3379
02:16:27,400 --> 02:16:28,360
Placed it, placed it

3380
02:16:28,360 --> 02:16:28,680
Thank you very much

3381
02:16:29,200 --> 02:16:29,640
Thank you very much

3382
02:16:32,469 --> 02:16:32,910
Alright

3383
02:16:39,299 --> 02:16:39,740
Yes

3384
02:16:39,740 --> 02:16:42,100
Fully prepared—OK

3385
02:16:42,100 --> 02:16:43,260
We'll go by voice call

3386
02:16:46,809 --> 02:16:50,110
Apply the brush

3387
02:16:54,859 --> 02:16:58,620
One person at bottom-right—yes, bottom-right

3388
02:16:58,620 --> 02:16:59,799
Nice!

3389
02:17:03,920 --> 02:17:06,440
One person at top-left—yes, exactly

3390
02:17:09,200 --> 02:17:10,478
Yes, holding a burger

3391
02:17:10,478 --> 02:17:11,120
Holding it now

3392
02:17:11,120 --> 02:17:11,580
Holding it

3393
02:17:14,609 --> 02:17:16,610
Holding it at bottom-left

3394
02:17:17,150 --> 02:17:18,950
One person—right now

3395
02:17:21,280 --> 02:17:24,500
Left

3396
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:30,459
In the back—there, there, nice!

3397
02:17:35,850 --> 02:17:37,549
Great—even with a handicap

3398
02:17:37,549 --> 02:17:40,350
It's good that you've gotten this skilled

3399
02:17:40,350 --> 02:17:44,100
Nice! If you need anything, just say so

3400
02:17:44,100 --> 02:17:46,100
Become even more like a god

3401
02:17:46,100 --> 02:17:48,080
No, that's right—Pekora, this is it

3402
02:17:48,080 --> 02:17:49,940
If everyone entered the same world

3403
02:17:49,940 --> 02:17:51,100
This would already break

3404
02:17:51,100 --> 02:17:51,680
This game

3405
02:17:52,219 --> 02:17:52,920
Yes, yes, exactly

3406
02:18:00,059 --> 02:18:02,200
I see, I can hold it

3407
02:18:02,760 --> 02:18:03,799
Pekoshi can hold it too

3408
02:18:05,850 --> 02:18:06,450
Can hold it

3409
02:18:08,150 --> 02:18:08,830
I can hold it

3410
02:18:10,080 --> 02:18:11,559
Right now, I might want you up top once

3411
02:18:12,900 --> 02:18:13,639
Bottom right

3412
02:18:14,780 --> 02:18:15,340
Top

3413
02:18:16,559 --> 02:18:17,520
Sorry, Pekoshi

3414
02:18:18,500 --> 02:18:19,040
Below that

3415
02:18:19,920 --> 02:18:20,600
Can hold it now

3416
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:23,200
Go, go, go!

3417
02:18:24,820 --> 02:18:26,360
Pekoshi, hold it once more

3418
02:18:26,360 --> 02:18:29,260
Hold it again, there, there, there

3419
02:18:29,260 --> 02:18:31,079
Might not be able to hold it again

3420
02:18:32,840 --> 02:18:33,879
Held it

3421
02:18:33,879 --> 02:18:36,750
I held it—I could hold it, right?

3422
02:18:38,420 --> 02:18:39,820
Sorry about that

3423
02:18:39,820 --> 02:18:40,260
Kaiko

3424
02:18:40,940 --> 02:18:41,920
It's going well

3425
02:18:42,980 --> 02:18:43,900
Ruka-senpai, right now

3426
02:18:43,900 --> 02:18:45,100
You're only holding a plate

3427
02:18:46,010 --> 02:18:46,690
This is a plate

3428
02:18:46,889 --> 02:18:47,570
That's a plate, so

3429
02:18:47,570 --> 02:18:48,150
Put it down once

3430
02:18:49,010 --> 02:18:50,230
Put it down once

3431
02:18:54,459 --> 02:18:55,559
Ah, so it's like this

3432
02:18:56,799 --> 02:18:59,420
Last person, go for it!

3433
02:19:00,219 --> 02:19:01,879
Last is cleaning

3434
02:19:02,219 --> 02:19:04,620
Don't need it? Okay, okay, okay

3435
02:19:04,620 --> 02:19:05,900
Cleared!

3436
02:19:06,080 --> 02:19:06,660
Cleared!

3437
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:09,219
Eh, already standing up?

3438
02:19:09,219 --> 02:19:09,660
Please

3439
02:19:10,180 --> 02:19:11,459
Sorry about that

3440
02:19:11,459 --> 02:19:14,058
After taking care of Pekora, I'm totally worn out

3441
02:19:16,080 --> 02:19:18,340
We still have about 3 more minutes

3442
02:19:18,920 --> 02:19:19,340
Hey

3443
02:19:19,340 --> 02:19:21,400
Come on, come on, come on—dangerous stove

3444
02:19:22,440 --> 02:19:23,100
The burner's igniting

3445
02:19:23,219 --> 02:19:23,680
Ah

3446
02:19:23,680 --> 02:19:27,240
It's fast, but the burner igniting is dangerous

3447
02:19:28,080 --> 02:19:30,059
I don't think we need the stove

3448
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:31,360
OK

3449
02:19:32,680 --> 02:19:34,240
Regular ones are fine

3450
02:19:36,410 --> 02:19:38,690
Seriously, just cleaning stuff is enough, right?

3451
02:19:41,400 --> 02:19:43,160
Huh? What's this—it's already started?

3452
02:19:43,260 --> 02:19:44,559
It's started! It's started!

3453
02:19:44,559 --> 02:19:45,799
Haven't been able to hold it yet

3454
02:19:45,799 --> 02:19:46,420
It's okay

3455
02:19:47,280 --> 02:19:48,040
Can hold it now

3456
02:19:48,040 --> 02:19:49,100
MeguMasep, you can hold it now

3457
02:19:49,100 --> 02:19:51,680
Please put it in the bottom left, bottom left

3458
02:19:54,360 --> 02:19:56,660
These two members with two items are way too convenient

3459
02:19:58,640 --> 02:19:59,500
Way too OP

3460
02:19:59,500 --> 02:20:00,680
MeguMasep, you can hold it now—nice!

3461
02:20:00,680 --> 02:20:01,680
Nice! It's working!

3462
02:20:01,680 --> 02:20:01,980
It's working

3463
02:20:05,110 --> 02:20:05,830
OK OK

3464
02:20:07,120 --> 02:20:09,440
Seriously respect... umm

3465
02:20:09,440 --> 02:20:11,840
Pekora-san, top left—there, there, there! Nice!

3466
02:20:14,910 --> 02:20:15,450
But hey

3467
02:20:15,450 --> 02:20:18,510
We were supposed to give instructions to Pekora and Su-chan

3468
02:20:18,510 --> 02:20:21,050
Next, take that and go to the bottom right

3469
02:20:21,050 --> 02:20:22,650
Ah, bottom right—got it, bottom right

3470
02:20:22,650 --> 02:20:22,970
This way, right?

3471
02:20:23,790 --> 02:20:24,150
Thank you

3472
02:20:25,330 --> 02:20:26,950
Su-chan's gotten incredibly good at taking care of Pekora

3473
02:20:26,950 --> 02:20:28,450
Unbelievably skilled

3474
02:20:28,450 --> 02:20:29,230
This is crazy

3475
02:20:29,770 --> 02:20:30,490
Yeah, yeah, yeah

3476
02:20:30,490 --> 02:20:33,750
So, can I just go to the top left like this?

3477
02:20:33,750 --> 02:20:34,670
Ah, it's fine, it's fine

3478
02:20:39,240 --> 02:20:41,000
Like this, bottom left

3479
02:20:41,930 --> 02:20:42,490
Okay

3480
02:20:43,290 --> 02:20:44,890
Huh? Oh, I get it now

3481
02:20:46,350 --> 02:20:46,850
Clear!

3482
02:20:46,990 --> 02:20:47,270
Ah

3483
02:20:47,850 --> 02:20:48,690
wwwww Wait, what?

3484
02:20:48,690 --> 02:20:49,610
Ah, no—it was just me clearing it

3485
02:20:49,610 --> 02:20:50,510
I only cleared it myself

3486
02:20:50,950 --> 02:20:51,620
Ah, oh no

3487
02:20:51,620 --> 02:20:51,850
Wait

3488
02:20:52,430 --> 02:20:52,710
This...

3489
02:20:52,710 --> 02:20:54,130
Pekora can't move right now!

3490
02:20:54,130 --> 02:20:55,610
Right now, I'm holding a dirty plate.

3491
02:20:55,610 --> 02:20:55,970
Pekora-san...

3492
02:20:56,490 --> 02:20:58,270
Ah, okay, okay, okay, like this...

3493
02:21:00,700 --> 02:21:01,140
Purun~

3494
02:21:02,330 --> 02:21:03,950
Ah, yoi-sho! Ara-ra-ra-ran!

3495
02:21:08,410 --> 02:21:08,690
Hey!

3496
02:21:09,170 --> 02:21:09,750
Senior Pekora...

3497
02:21:09,750 --> 02:21:09,990
Um...

3498
02:21:10,610 --> 02:21:12,530
Right, right—ah, um, upper left, upper left!

3499
02:21:13,440 --> 02:21:13,920
Upper left!

3500
02:21:14,240 --> 02:21:14,820
Ah!

3501
02:21:15,620 --> 02:21:17,180
Wait a sec—oh no, oh no!

3502
02:21:17,180 --> 02:21:17,910
Ah, sorryy~!

3503
02:21:22,130 --> 02:21:23,430
It's over~!

3504
02:21:23,910 --> 02:21:26,830
It's done—it's all over~!

3505
02:21:26,830 --> 02:21:28,010
Seriously?!

3506
02:21:28,950 --> 02:21:32,830
Sorry, I used Pekora's thingy~

3507
02:21:32,830 --> 02:21:33,910
It's alright!

3508
02:21:33,910 --> 02:21:36,570
But did we make it to around day 5?

3509
02:21:36,570 --> 02:21:36,730
Right now...

3510
02:21:39,410 --> 02:21:43,350
If we managed to reach around day 5 with this lag...

3511
02:21:43,350 --> 02:21:45,510
The moment Pekora truly has no more lag...

3512
02:21:45,510 --> 02:21:46,630
We could definitely get into the top 8!

3513
02:21:46,630 --> 02:21:49,310
But thanks to Senior Pekora's lag...

3514
02:21:49,310 --> 02:21:50,750
I feel like I've gotten way better!

3515
02:21:52,389 --> 02:21:54,310
I really feel like I've improved a lot!

3516
02:21:55,420 --> 02:21:56,140
Yeah, that's true~

3517
02:21:57,450 --> 02:21:58,790
Though it'd still be better without lag~

3518
02:21:59,530 --> 02:22:00,670
What should we do, then~?

3519
02:22:01,510 --> 02:22:03,290
But honestly, even if we keep going like this right now...

3520
02:22:03,290 --> 02:22:06,090
It wouldn't count as proper practice, and I feel bad about that~

3521
02:22:06,090 --> 02:22:07,170
No, no, not at all!

3522
02:22:07,630 --> 02:22:09,030
Then let's do it again sometime!

3523
02:22:09,030 --> 02:22:10,210
If you have time later...

3524
02:22:10,210 --> 02:22:11,910
Maybe we could gather again privately or something...

3525
02:22:11,910 --> 02:22:14,109
Yeah, that sounds good—I really want to!

3526
02:22:14,109 --> 02:22:16,630
Let's practice properly today!

3527
02:22:16,630 --> 02:22:18,049
The lag seems pretty bad too...

3528
02:22:18,049 --> 02:22:19,830
So let's wrap it up for now...

3529
02:22:20,249 --> 02:22:22,650
And definitely do it again when our schedules align!

3530
02:22:23,830 --> 02:22:25,930
Thank you so much!

3531
02:22:29,730 --> 02:22:32,130
Let's work hard on team coordination, okay?

3532
02:22:32,130 --> 02:22:33,290
Let's do our best and win!

3533
02:22:33,290 --> 02:22:35,390
We won't lose to lag!

3534
02:22:35,390 --> 02:22:37,450
Pekora, you do your best too—let's win!

3535
02:22:37,450 --> 02:22:40,130
Let's win—let's go for victory!

3536
02:22:41,730 --> 02:22:42,170
Well then...

3537
02:22:42,170 --> 02:22:44,990
For the last one, on the count of three—what should we say?

3538
02:22:45,410 --> 02:22:47,710
On three: 'We will absolutely win!'

3539
02:22:47,710 --> 02:22:50,670
Let's aim for 1st place! That's it—long, loooong...

3540
02:22:50,670 --> 02:22:51,720
We will absolutely win!

3541
02:22:51,720 --> 02:22:53,570
Aim for 1st place! Loong, loooong...

3542
02:22:53,570 --> 02:22:58,910
On three: 'We will absolutely win!'

3543
02:22:58,910 --> 02:23:01,630
Aim for 1st place!

3544
02:23:02,110 --> 02:23:03,870
All over the place...

3545
02:23:04,790 --> 02:23:06,150
Bye-bye!

3546
02:23:06,300 --> 02:23:09,400
Bye-bye!
