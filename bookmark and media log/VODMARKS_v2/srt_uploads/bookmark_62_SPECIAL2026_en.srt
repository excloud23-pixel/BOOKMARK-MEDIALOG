1
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,840
Open, open stream

2
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:47,670
So, with that said,

3
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:51,250
Today we have 3 Japanese speakers,

4
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,590
4 English speakers,

5
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,080
4 English speakers,

6
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,380
3 English speakers,

7
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,620
1 Indonesian speaker—sorry!

8
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,620
Sorry!

9
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,030
Close one, close one!

10
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:05,910
Whether it's Japanese or Indonesian,

11
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,970
or even English, Zeta-chan here

12
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,630
can speak them all, but

13
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,190
today,

14
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,730
together with Team Kaze

15
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:17,510
and those who will be playing Super Smash Bros.,

16
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:21,649
we’re going to play 300% Super Smash Bros.

17
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:22,890
and have some fun!

18
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,460
So, with that said,

19
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,140
let’s start with introductions first.

20
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,340
Sound check and

21
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,560
well then,

22
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,820
Kari, please go ahead.

23
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:41,180
Hello everyone! It's me, Mori Kurai--P from Hololive

24
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,200
English Myth! Let's have fun!

25
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:50,970
Let's enjoy! Enjoy, enjoy!

26
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,650
Alright, Gigi,

27
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,310
everyone,

28
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,239
It's me,

29
00:04:57,239 --> 00:04:58,570
Hololive's

30
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,120
Ingrid Justice,

31
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,490
Gigi Mo Nin,

32
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,570
Far Feaster, yo!

33
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,650
Yay!

34
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:06,710
Yay!

35
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:10,870
Please, okayu~

36
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:15,430
Yes, munch munch, okayu~

37
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:18,470
I'm Nekomata Okayu from Hololive Gamers.

38
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:21,890
Today I haven't played Smash in forever,

39
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,730
so please go easy on me!

40
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,830
Yeah!

41
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:28,010
Well then,

42
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,590
Not Beginner or Not Beginner...

43
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:33,290
Seriously though, I'm totally bad at it!

44
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,970
With Smash, I'm genuinely either really good or really bad.

45
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,370
Definitely skilled, maybe! Yay!

46
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,290
Alright, so then,

47
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:43,670
next up is Shiori.

48
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:46,510
Ah, Shiorin!

49
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,030
This is Shiorin's Bella.

50
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:53,370
Your servant, so please enjoy the Hololive archive!

51
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:54,990
Oh, nice! Please take care of me!

52
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,250
Nemu nemu

53
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:00,790
Nemu nemu

54
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:01,610
Nemu nemu

55
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,110
Thanks, okay?

56
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:04,870
Yes.

57
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:05,640
Yes.

58
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,630
Then, Zeta,

59
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,120
Yes.

60
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,080
Aaami shan stand!

61
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,599
Hello!

62
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,490
I'm a total beginner.

63
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:16,020
Everyone, please be kind to me!

64
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:19,840
Don't worry!

65
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,160
Toa just installed it a moment ago too,

66
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,360
so same here.

67
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,320
Yes.

68
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,460
Then Fubu-chan, please go ahead.

69
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,050
Yes, Fubu King Krule here.

70
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:32,630
Nice to meet you all!

71
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:36,490
Fubu King Krule, that's right.

72
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,450
We'll be going with Fubu King Krule,

73
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:39,270
so please take care of me!

74
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:39,850
Yes.

75
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:42,830
Thank you very much! Yes.

76
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:44,070
So, with that said,

77
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:48,720
Kon'yappi and Wasabi here! Yes!

78
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,220
Thank you very much!

79
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:52,340
Seriously,

80
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,260
we're real beginners, so

81
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,940
I hope we can just have fun today.

82
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,850
Today only investigators showed up, huh?

83
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:03,090
Well then,

84
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:06,520
what should we do? Who fights? Alright, alright,

85
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,630
let's start with the first match.

86
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:09,890
Do your best!

87
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,930
Scary! Come on, get up, get up!

88
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,370
Scary, scary, scary!

89
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:14,750
Come on

90
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,250
Come on, hurry up

91
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,450
If nobody's going up

92
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,210
What the hell? Hurry up!

93
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,510
Come on, come on

94
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,270
Come on, nice

95
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:23,630
Nice

96
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,210
Two more people

97
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:26,930
Two more

98
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,520
Nice

99
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,160
Nice, one more

100
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,880
Woof woof

101
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,300
Pichu, catch, catch, oh!

102
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,540
Nice! We won!

103
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,660
Octabby, together!

104
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,960
Double Kirby

105
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,780
Pichu

106
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,140
I don't get how to do it

107
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:48,880
Sorry

108
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,500
I'm Black Kirby—huh? Black Kirby?

109
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,520
Wait a sec

110
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,220
Oh no, oh no

111
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,340
How do I fly?

112
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,290
That's amazing

113
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:04,910
Shiorin-san

114
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:08,430
Hold on

115
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:12,379
Oh no

116
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:12,920
Okaeri-san

117
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,660
Neta Samado-chan, this is bad

118
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:20,300
Shiorin-san, the Halberd—huh?

119
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,600
Wait a moment

120
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,180
Shiorin-san

121
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:30,320
Shiorin-san, I died

122
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,240
With Okaeri-san

123
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:38,580
With Okaeri-san—it's scary! No way!

124
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,200
That's strong

125
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,700
This is strong

126
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:54,040
Do your best—quickly! It's decided

127
00:08:54,040 --> 00:09:00,120
Congratulations—you're strong

128
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,480
I got killed twice by Shiori

129
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,800
Shiori

130
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:08,610
Strong

131
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,820
Then let's switch next

132
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,340
Let's switch

133
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,220
Let's switch

134
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,900
Then do your best

135
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,580
Jiji and Zeta, and

136
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,020
Fugu-chan and one more person—let's go

137
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,820
Then let's go with Towa—okay

138
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,380
Let's go

139
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,680
Ah, Steve

140
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,220
Steve

141
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,040
Steve

142
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,580
Wasn't Steve supposed to be strong?

143
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,180
Steve is a power character

144
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,140
Clever

145
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,850
Steve appearing here is unexpected

146
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,410
That's really dangerous

147
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,670
I am Steve

148
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,670
I am Steve

149
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,490
I am Steve—what's this?

150
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,230
What's this?

151
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,990
Wait, wait, wait, wait

152
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,130
Jijii, stop it

153
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,370
Jijii, hold on

154
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,600
Wait a sec, Jijii, stop it

155
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:14,840
Stop it

156
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:17,930
That's not it

157
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:21,170
Team Fu, do your best—wait!

158
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,690
It already hurts—so intense

159
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:29,670
Super Minecraft-like

160
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:42,590
Is that Jaita's HP?

161
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,990
We need to explain the HP settings

162
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:46,530
Yeah

163
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,090
An incredibly active stage

164
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:49,830
Ah, ah, ow

165
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:51,680
Fubu-chan, can you even do it?

166
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,590
Fubu-chan, can you even do it?

167
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,630
Fubu-chan, can you even do it? That

168
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:54,590
Hey

169
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:57,110
Huh? Why are you so yellow?

170
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,130
Huh? Why are both of you super yellow?

171
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,130
Yellow

172
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:03,210
It's yellow—grabbed the coin, then ouch

173
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:04,250
Nice

174
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,030
Did it, did it—nice

175
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:06,970
Zenta

176
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:07,810
Let's go

177
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:09,430
Go Mario

178
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,150
Mario's bouncing around

179
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,290
Bouncing around

180
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:16,840
Zenta's bouncing like crazy

181
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,920
Zenta jumping

182
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:23,530
The guard is usable too—that's seriously impressive.

183
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,190
You're actually using it well.

184
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,030
Is there a one-in-a-million chance?

185
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,830
This one exists! It exists!

186
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:31,450
Is there a one-in-a-million chance?

187
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:32,010
Could it be...?

188
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,950
Back ring.

189
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,080
There it is—!

190
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,950
Amazing! Amazing!

191
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,310
What is this place?

192
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,270
What happens when you collect lots of coins?

193
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,210
How is Zetta even alive?

194
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:57,729
Zetta, starting from 0% like that...

195
00:11:57,729 --> 00:11:58,610
Because we're starting fresh.

196
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,130
I just messed up the settings a bit.

197
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:01,090
The settings are messed up.

198
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah—it's fine.

199
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:03,170
I'll sort it out later.

200
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:04,450
Later.

201
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:06,050
We can adjust the settings later.

202
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,750
Let's fix the settings later.

203
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,430
It's getting a bit too strong.

204
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,280
So strong—

205
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:17,690
That...

206
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:18,510
Ah, I see it!

207
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:20,150
I laughed.

208
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:22,170
Um...

209
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:26,970
What's that? That character's strong. It's the bottom right.

210
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:30,350
Bottom right, bottom right.

211
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,870
From the character select screen...

212
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:36,430
You can change it from the character select.

213
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,970
Wait a sec.

214
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,960
Waiting for other players... Ah, fixed it! Fixed it!

215
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,600
This is definitely it.

216
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,340
Season 3 is short.

217
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,670
Isn't that not really true?

218
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,270
Totally normal.

219
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:58,890
Yeah, that's right.

220
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,230
Instead of Kirby...

221
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,450
Let's try Fox instead.

222
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,270
Nice! Let's try all sorts of characters.

223
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,760
Alright, 300%.

224
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,380
300%.

225
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,160
300%.

226
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:30,090
Good! Next one. Nice!

227
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:30,470
Nice!

228
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,690
Good! Next!

229
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:40,590
Old man, old man—go! I'm Steve.

230
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,910
I'm Steve. Nice!

231
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:48,590
Nice! Steve! Steve!

232
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,550
I hate Peach! Let's go!

233
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:52,090
It's Peach!

234
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:53,310
Peach! Peach!

235
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:56,110
Peach! Peach! Peach! So cute!

236
00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:00,490
Team English! Let's go! Indeed, Team English!

237
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:02,350
Your Team English...

238
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,250
Turned into Yoshi.

239
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,510
Yoshi!

240
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:06,830
Here.

241
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:08,950
Sorry.

242
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:15,380
Strong! Sorry! Oh no!

243
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:19,070
Sorry! I want to do my best!

244
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:20,380
That's great.

245
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,459
Jiji is hiding.

246
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,279
Hiding Jiji.

247
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,180
It's One Vee Van!

248
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,000
Still going!

249
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,460
Still going!

250
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,750
Are they crafting something?

251
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,110
They're making something, right?

252
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:00,590
You were doing great.

253
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:04,810
You're trying hard—strong!

254
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:06,510
You're getting stronger!

255
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:08,090
It's okay! It's okay!

256
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:14,700
Strong! Nice! Steve's the strongest!

257
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,020
Steve's strong!

258
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,580
Steve! Strong! Strong!

259
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,400
Na—

260
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:27,350
Ice fight!

261
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,770
Nice fight! Next!

262
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,500
Then shall we do it? Please go ahead.

263
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,600
So, the real match starts at 300% damage, right?

264
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah—oh, I see!

265
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,860
So that's why you're practicing—I get it.

266
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:55,620
At 300%, each person fights twice—two rounds.

267
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:55,920
I see.

268
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,300
Fight twice until reaching 300% damage.

269
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,340
Well then...

270
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,020
Hunt Open is also included. End.

271
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,720
Wait—it's changing!

272
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,340
Pikachu

273
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:21,020
Pikachu is Pikomi's color—really!

274
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,000
This is strong

275
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,740
What is this?

276
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,480
It's been crazy the whole time

277
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,040
Pi

278
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:36,070
Kachuu, that's crazy

279
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:37,090
Crazy

280
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:37,930
Crazy

281
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:38,790
Crazy

282
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:40,869
Hunting is insane

283
00:16:40,869 --> 00:16:41,440
Hunting is insane

284
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:41,890
Hunting is insane

285
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:46,960
Where'd it go?

286
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,090
The door

287
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:47,950
Where'd it go?

288
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:48,450
Where'd it go?

289
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,750
I was dead before I realized it

290
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,010
Pikachu

291
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,110
Pikachu

292
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,410
Pikachu

293
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,230
Pikachu

294
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:07,839
Crazy

295
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,910
Strong

296
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:10,490
So strong

297
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,410
Good

298
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:15,930
Delicious

299
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,069
Too good

300
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:18,670
It's decided, right?

301
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:20,650
Wait

302
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:23,970
Pikachu, Pikachu, Pikachu

303
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:26,050
Pikachu, strong Pikachu

304
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:26,790
Way too crazy

305
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:30,550
Hey, let me see your Pikachu for a sec—Pikachu looks good

306
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,630
Pikachu Pikachu is way too crazy

307
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:33,690
Pika Pika Festival

308
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,370
Pika Pika Festival

309
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:38,550
Is it turning into a Pika Fest?

310
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:38,970
Pika Fest

311
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:42,110
Pika Fest Pikachu Pikachu

312
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:47,530
Pikachu Pikachu

313
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,990
Let's decide with this

314
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:51,590
Ah, it's Steve

315
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:54,570
Steve's strong, huh

316
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:55,690
Steve again

317
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,920
What move is Pikachu using?

318
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,440
Which button?

319
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,720
Isn't it Thunder with Down+B?

320
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:04,860
Yes

321
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,770
Yeah, Pikachu

322
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:06,700
Down+B is

323
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,200
Vertical Thunder, right?

324
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,460
Like this, then C

325
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,860
I died myself though

326
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,640
TNT is insane

327
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:16,920
Wait a sec

328
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,980
First off, TNT

329
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,660
Wait a moment

330
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,140
Is Down+B like this?

331
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,190
Like this, right? Pikachu

332
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:33,410
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch

333
00:18:36,669 --> 00:18:38,990
I killed myself

334
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,940
Upwards

335
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,700
Crazy, wait a sec

336
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:52,980
From 10 items like this, Pikachu

337
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,730
Pikachu, goodbye

338
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,210
Crazy

339
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:58,730
Ouch

340
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,830
It's Peach—Peach is strong

341
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:08,790
When someone wins

342
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,830
It's funny how that character suddenly seems strong

343
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,130
Korokoro

344
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:13,790
Korokoro

345
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,050
Nori-chan is strong, right?

346
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:19,150
Scary, scary—definitely strong

347
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,270
High-power Shiori

348
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:21,850
Haain

349
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:23,470
Well then

350
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,930
But Pikachu seems good

351
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,370
I just studied with Kano

352
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,050
Yeah, right?

353
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:34,050
Pikachu festival—let's go Pikachu!

354
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:35,150
This time, I

355
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:37,590
Roshyu—ah, sorry

356
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,510
Masked Pikachu

357
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,770
Masked Pikachu

358
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,300
Looks strong, doesn't it?

359
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:49,880
King

360
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,560
Three Yoshis, three Yoshis

361
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,440
It's a pink Yoshi

362
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,940
Seems a bit off though

363
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:06,820
How do you use it? Where is it?

364
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:26,440
Guard is strong—Pika Pika

365
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:38,210
Was flying—way too strong!

366
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:41,330
Isn't this guy way too strong?

367
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,370
This guy?

368
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:45,050
As I thought, it's this King...

369
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:47,769
King K. Rool isn't here yet, you know, the one with all that nonsense.

370
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,050
King K. Rool!

371
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:52,730
What character is this? Is it Donkey Kong?

372
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:54,470
It's Donkey Kong!

373
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:56,810
Right, he's Donkey's boss.

374
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:59,030
If it's Donkey, maybe we can win?

375
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,060
Might actually work out!

376
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:04,720
Back when we fought Sephiroth and stuff...

377
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,650
He was strong!

378
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:07,180
Sephiroth's here!

379
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,180
Let's go with Sephiroth!

380
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:12,000
Sephiroth's weapon has such long reach!

381
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,060
Oh, really?

382
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,340
I haven't played FF7, but that's fine, right?

383
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:22,440
After trying out all kinds of characters...

384
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,160
You can join in too!

385
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,820
Go ahead, totally fine!

386
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,420
Even if you join multiple times in a row, it's okay!

387
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,680
Is Sephiroth scary or Donkey Kong—huh?

388
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:33,920
Mille!

389
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:35,540
Mille's here!

390
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:37,300
Mille's here!

391
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,240
The gap between warrior gods is insane!

392
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,820
Way too insane!

393
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,510
Gigi, your face!

394
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,920
Face black!

395
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:45,890
Sam!

396
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,060
Undertale!

397
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:48,940
Huh?!

398
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,680
So big!

399
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:51,530
So big!

400
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:55,550
Long reach!

401
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:57,830
Let's go, Gigi!

402
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:04,860
Sans is strong—super strong!

403
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,740
Sephiroth looks like he has long reach too!

404
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,400
I can walk, but I can't run though...

405
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:18,800
Sephiroth!

406
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,580
Sans is amazing! Yay!

407
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,080
Strong!

408
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,620
While showing off...

409
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,020
I can smell it!

410
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,740
Go for it! Go for it!

411
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,370
Let's go!

412
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,570
What's this?

413
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:48,690
Awesome, Gigi!

414
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:50,950
Not Gigi—

415
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:51,910
Sans...

416
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,130
Sans' voice!

417
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:04,340
This...

418
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:09,380
Finding the right character really matters, huh.

419
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:10,860
Yeah!

420
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,600
Best Character Select!

421
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,840
You gotta find your best character, you guys.

422
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,240
I'm just picking randomly now.

423
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,220
I thought that's what everyone was doing.

424
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:27,650
You can randomly pick colors too—hold on...

425
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,280
Let me try!

426
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,930
Pika!

427
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:35,690
Nshuu!

428
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:40,210
Hey!

429
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,650
Father! Are there only seven characters?!

430
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,310
64—lol!

431
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,440
Go ahead, go ahead!

432
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,680
Sure thing!

433
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,600
This might be good!

434
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:56,950
Should I join?

435
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:58,170
What?

436
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:08,130
Whoa, Sephiroth took off his clothes—what is this?!

437
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:10,810
Off-screen Sephiroth!

438
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:12,430
Off-screen Sephiroth!

439
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:14,290
Ugh, I hate this—it's pitch black!

440
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:17,050
Scary! So scary! What is this place?!

441
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,690
Mario!

442
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,370
There's no robot here!

443
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,200
Please, I wanna dig—ow! Sorry!

444
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,520
What is this place?

445
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:39,630
Oh no, it's Sephiroth calling!

446
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:46,550
All alone... another one!

447
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,090
Ah, apparently someone got trapped between them!

448
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:55,240
Whoa, stop it—!

449
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,260
There's always something inside trees, right?

450
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:04,040
I don't get it—wait, yeah, I get it!

451
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,260
There's always something inside trees, you know!

452
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,940
What happened?

453
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,400
It's gonna explode!

454
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,040
Inside the tree

455
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:15,120
Ah, that's amazing! So smart!

456
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:23,280
Towa's lack of character has been exposed

457
00:25:24,989 --> 00:25:26,810
It'll open right away

458
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:27,230
Pretty much

459
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:31,990
Someone

460
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:35,190
Come on, come on!

461
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:40,600
Everyone's choosing different things

462
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,950
Alright, nice choice

463
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:45,170
Nice

464
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:50,690
Leave it to me—what is this robot?

465
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:56,430
Ah-wah, ah-wah-wah-wah

466
00:25:56,430 --> 00:26:05,750
I knew you would make that joke. I was thinking it too. No way!

467
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:09,320
Stayway Brave, oh!

468
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:14,020
What is this? Ugh, what is this, seriously?

469
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:14,740
What is this?

470
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:18,080
I-way Stream Metal Frink

471
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,040
Why are you telling me this?

472
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,320
Whoa!

473
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,620
Ribgukob

474
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,500
Connect it

475
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,560
Robot

476
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,020
No way, no way!

477
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,300
No way, no way! Strong robot!

478
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:39,240
Get over here, geez, you know!

479
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,420
Dad, do we...?

480
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,710
Huh?

481
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:42,420
Huh?

482
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:42,920
Huh?

483
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,240
Huh?

484
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,140
Huh?

485
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:44,659
Huh?

486
00:26:44,659 --> 00:26:44,820
Huh?

487
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:45,920
Oh!

488
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,400
Oh!

489
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:46,700
Oh!

490
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,180
Yay!

491
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:50,660
Yay!

492
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:50,720
No!

493
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,080
No!

494
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,500
No!

495
00:26:58,630 --> 00:26:59,850
Robo strong

496
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,930
Robo's so strong

497
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:07,530
Everyone's characters look strong

498
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:10,130
When you win, you know...

499
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:13,510
No shirt

500
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:17,949
Off-screen Sephiroth

501
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,990
Private Sephiroth

502
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:24,229
Private Jora, stop it!

503
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:26,390
You're kidding!

504
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:26,790
Sephiroth

505
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,590
At home, he doesn't wear clothes

506
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,070
Bayonetta

507
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:33,210
Oshiorizu character—so sexy

508
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:38,700
Bayonetta's cute

509
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,000
Sexy

510
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,380
Sexy Night Birdie

511
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,080
What is this place?

512
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:45,260
This...

513
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,980
It's Mother 3's garage

514
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,440
First, let's pick this up here

515
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,920
I've picked up so much already, I'm confused

516
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:57,580
Stop eating, just for a bit

517
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,880
This is strong

518
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,480
That's way too crazy

519
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,270
Crazy

520
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,940
Wait a sec, Chimera's appearing

521
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:06,880
Crazy

522
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,160
What is this?

523
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,420
Hey, that hits!

524
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,200
One hit

525
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:11,990
One hit

526
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:12,460
One hit

527
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,280
This is crazy

528
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,340
It's coming

529
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,720
It's coming, crazy

530
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,640
Crazy

531
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,680
Sorry

532
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:29,430
Up there, super...

533
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,880
This, I mean...

534
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,750
If you pick up the stage, it's dangerous

535
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:42,030
Do your best

536
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:46,180
Bye-bye

537
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:51,080
Sorry, that's sad

538
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:51,690
Let's go

539
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:52,970
Ugh, wow

540
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,170
Won, won

541
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:55,490
Won

542
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:02,340
Run away

543
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:02,890
Run away

544
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:31,030
Here you go—oh!

545
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:32,970
Yeah

546
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:35,770
Ttaa~

547
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,120
Yatta~!

548
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,700
Bennett is tough.

549
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,140
Bennett is tough.

550
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:44,980
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

551
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:51,080
Samus's charged attack is scary! Samus's charged attack...

552
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,120
It'd be nice if it were spacious.

553
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,820
The stage—yeah, definitely.

554
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,940
Stages are random anyway.

555
00:29:57,159 --> 00:29:58,420
That's true too.

556
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,360
Matchups matter, yeah.

557
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,620
I also want to try out some characters...

558
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,520
...so I’ll give it a go!

559
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:18,170
What about Donkey Kong?

560
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,410
Donkey’s strong, I think—his down-B.

561
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:21,110
It’s super strong.

562
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:22,170
Down-B.

563
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:23,970
You know...

564
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:26,930
If you just keep spamming down-B, B, B, B, B, B—it’s really strong!

565
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:28,090
Oh, huh!

566
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:31,570
OK!

567
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:35,999
Let's go! Let's go! Oh!

568
00:30:35,999 --> 00:30:37,010
It’s Joker!

569
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:40,810
Joker! Joker! I'm the Joker!

570
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:43,250
I'm the Joker, baby—ah!

571
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:46,790
Kirby actually seems strong.

572
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:49,689
When I thought Kirby was strong...

573
00:30:49,689 --> 00:30:52,130
...it was crazy, seriously. Poyo!

574
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:57,190
Poyo poyo poyo—Mario!

575
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,370
Z has become Samus.

576
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:07,390
Z is B-button, B-button! Meme—OK!

577
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:15,170
B-button, full max charge!

578
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:22,180
No way, no way, no way!

579
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:24,980
Oh yes, yes, yes!

580
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,500
Gonna charge for a bit.

581
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,340
Nice missile!

582
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:51,700
And then Zizeta! Zizeta!

583
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:56,160
Golden Car! Golden balls! Golden balls!

584
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:05,980
Yay! *clap clap clap*

585
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:10,390
Okai-san!

586
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,820
You’re out! Huh?

587
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:16,840
Golden balls!

588
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,580
Okai said it!

589
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,890
And besides, Curry—

590
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:23,560
—there’s even a name like 'Golden Balls English'!

591
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:27,680
Golden Ball, everyone!

592
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,500
Even in Japanese, you kinda know it, right?

593
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,460
Golden Ball!

594
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,040
Golden Ball!

595
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,500
OK, Golden Ball!

596
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,200
I love Golden Ball!

597
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:43,920
OK, that got a laugh! It really did!

598
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,040
Good for you!

599
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,100
Worldwide Gold Ghost!

600
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,100
It’s over already.

601
00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:01,210
Guess it really does get across—bye-bye!

602
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,580
Plus...

603
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,700
...it’s Door-sama’s frame, you know? Seriously!

604
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,120
Everyone uses other people’s frames...

605
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,820
Golden Ball!

606
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:10,580
Don’t say it so much!

607
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,760
Golden Ball—sorry!

608
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:18,810
Wait, this place...

609
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:20,950
...wasn’t this somewhere you shouldn’t get caught by your mom?

610
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:23,270
Ah, seriously—you really shouldn’t get caught here by your mom!

611
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:23,480
Yeah, yeah!

612
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,790
You really mustn’t get caught!

613
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:26,029
Oh!

614
00:33:26,029 --> 00:33:27,110
Huh... ho...

615
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,640
—

616
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,160
Ah—

617
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,460
Boon!

618
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,020
Okae!

619
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,620
Okae’s strong! Okae’s strong!

620
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:40,600
Okae!

621
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,400
Whoa—ah!

622
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:46,380
Whoa!

623
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:52,080
Strong! Ora! Congratulations!

624
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,340
So strong!

625
00:33:56,790 --> 00:34:01,870
Alright! Recommended Samus! Recommended!

626
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:03,090
Yeah.

627
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,850
She’s strong, right?

628
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:08,630
Samus is definitely strong, but...

629
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:09,989
...probably...

630
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:13,690
...Senior Okae’s Samus...

631
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:15,870
...and my Samus are a little different.

632
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:19,290
That's not true at all.

633
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:33,179
One more, one more, one more

634
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:40,739
One more to go

635
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:42,280
Let's go!

636
00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:45,500
Long time no see!

637
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,940
Fox is so narrow.

638
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,780
Donkey is huge!

639
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,440
It'd be bad if you fall!

640
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:52,840
Bye-bye!

641
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,400
What?

642
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:58,980
Stop!

643
00:34:59,040 --> 00:34:59,740
Too strong!

644
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,980
This is strong!

645
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,440
Super scary!

646
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,100
Scary!

647
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:19,820
Bye-bye!

648
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,670
Zelda can jump too, so...

649
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:26,030
Might be strong, yeah.

650
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:28,420
Yeah, having long-range is really strong, isn't it?

651
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:30,920
Zelda's cute, huh?

652
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:35,800
Zero na—

653
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,310
Nice! Wait a sec...

654
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:41,340
Let's go with Donkey again.

655
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,420
Donkey might be good too.

656
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,090
Come on, Shiori!

657
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:47,990
Come on, Shiori!

658
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:48,780
Come on, Shiori!

659
00:35:54,050 --> 00:36:03,740
Steve!

660
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,280
I'm Steve.

661
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:16,460
Steve, Steve, Sonic!

662
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:34,800
It's literally the curve that lets Steve ride the minecart!

663
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,340
Straight ahead!

664
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:44,190
Steve!

665
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:44,530
Geez!

666
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,460
Steve!

667
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,540
Steve!

668
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:54,800
Steve!

669
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:54,960
Steve!

670
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,660
This is tough!

671
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:01,260
Live 3's potato was a perfect game!

672
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:08,020
The map is crazy good—Steve!

673
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:11,060
Steve's minecart was amazing!

674
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,820
Steve's minecart is insane!

675
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:15,739
That curve is wild!

676
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:24,090
Gee Gee, come on!

677
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:25,610
Gee Gee, come on! Here it comes, here it comes!

678
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:25,870
It's coming!

679
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:28,070
Scary, scary!

680
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:30,770
Steve!

681
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:34,330
Hang in there, Steve!

682
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:42,700
Where's Shirtless Steve?

683
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:43,840
Huh?

684
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,840
Couldn't see it.

685
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,420
Like Donkey and...

686
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,080
Scary!

687
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,350
Oh no!

688
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:56,120
Wait, is that corpse Steve? That's bad!

689
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,140
Sorry, everyone—I couldn't get you in.

690
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,840
I'm sorry.

691
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,500
I'm sorry.

692
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:06,880
Just listen to my voice...

693
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,820
Sorry.

694
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:12,210
Please just imagine it from my voice.

695
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,540
Steve's insane!

696
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,180
Scary!

697
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,410
Dangerous!

698
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:21,620
Steve's scary!

699
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:32,260
Steve LT

700
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,880
TNT tr

701
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:43,470
o

702
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,380
Minecart jammed, Ste

703
00:38:47,809 --> 00:38:55,550
ve! Steve, you're seriously great!

704
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,500
Steve!

705
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,200
Steve's scary!

706
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,140
Amazing!

707
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:03,860
Nice fight!

708
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:05,840
Nice fight!

709
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,180
Nice fight!

710
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:07,900
Wha—

711
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:09,720
—ba!

712
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:12,360
My palms are sweating like crazy from the one-on-one with Steve!

713
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,400
Oh no, oh no!

714
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,360
Gee Gee, Steve is seriously scary!

715
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:19,330
Nice fight!

716
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:21,430
Shoot!

717
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:22,790
Shoot!

718
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:25,210
Shoot, Steve!

719
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:27,590
Next, I'll use Sharpless Cephalos!

720
00:39:28,229 --> 00:39:30,070
I'll use Sharpless! Sharpless!

721
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:32,570
Sharpless's shirt

722
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:34,150
Sharpless's shirt

723
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:35,970
Steve's shirt

724
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:36,800
Good idea

725
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,790
Wait, wait a sec

726
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:41,970
Sephiroth

727
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:47,730
Sephiroth's shirt—Sephiroth's shirt is insane!

728
00:39:48,249 --> 00:39:49,470
The stream layout itself

729
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,270
Turns skin-colored? No way!

730
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:52,510
Setty... Sepharize

731
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:54,610
Yes

732
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:57,250
Another Sepharize

733
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:58,030
Another one

734
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:01,630
Using a sword, yes

735
00:40:01,979 --> 00:40:05,060
Thanks! Let's go—this is insane!

736
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:10,290
Off-shot Sephiroth

737
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:12,510
Private Sephiroth

738
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:13,530
No

739
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:15,230
This is crazy!

740
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:19,470
Private time, okay

741
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:21,630
It's a summer vacation

742
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:25,230
Handsome guy vacation

743
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,590
Handsome guy

744
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:29,890
Springs Vacation, huh

745
00:40:31,999 --> 00:40:33,060
Still alive

746
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,040
Still alive—alright!

747
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,000
Ah

748
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,480
Ah, Zero's vacation

749
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,810
Ah, Shiori Silver—whoa!

750
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:43,490
It's Jora!

751
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:43,910
Jora

752
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:46,190
Seriously, it's Silver

753
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:50,670
Seriously! It's Silver together!

754
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:52,570
Which one is Kan-chan's?

755
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:54,790
Ku-na Kan

756
00:40:56,210 --> 00:40:56,610
Kan

757
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:42,729
This is a scene I've seen so many times

758
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,020
If he didn't have a shirt

759
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,300
He'd get even stronger

760
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,420
If he really had no shirt

761
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,360
He'd get even stronger

762
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,440
You're joking—laughing

763
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,019
It's turning into a joke party

764
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,940
It's turning into a joke party

765
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:06,310
There's no character who can take off clothes either

766
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:08,989
Alright then, let's go with a character who can strip

767
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:10,970
A character who can undress

768
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:14,630
Off-shot character, off-shot character

769
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:18,070
Doesn't Link have any off-shots?

770
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:20,230
Link probably doesn't

771
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:21,430
No Link, huh

772
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:25,370
Like Donkey Kong

773
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:27,790
He's basically not even wearing anything already

774
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:29,310
True

775
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:31,550
Team Off-shot

776
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:35,070
Let's go

777
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:39,550
Curry, come on—Summer Vacation Curry, come on—that's right

778
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:43,330
Okay, I'm coming in! Okay, let's go!

779
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:44,630
Okay

780
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,120
Alright

781
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:49,630
Ah

782
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:51,040
Fulton’s here already!

783
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,900
I missed it again!

784
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:53,660
It's super thin

785
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,380
Looks like the three brothers now

786
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,270
Sorry

787
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:03,160
I still don't know who the detective is

788
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,840
I have to stay here, right?

789
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:05,840
While being here

790
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,400
I guess I have to touch this spot

791
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,195
Just for fun, okay?

792
00:43:09,195 --> 00:43:14,420
Which character would be good?

793
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:24,460
Car! It's a car!

794
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,160
Ouch

795
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:30,890
Huh?

796
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:35,510
Is Link strong?

797
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:15,010
Gigi is House

798
00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:19,870
The Geezer is House, Steve

799
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:22,270
Steve number one

800
00:44:22,439 --> 00:44:24,360
Steve is crazy!

801
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:29,590
He's just really good at using Steve

802
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:31,450
Probably 'cause Gigi's skilled

803
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:37,610
It's the Mind Card

804
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:39,230
The Mind Card is strong

805
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:41,090
That's all there is to it

806
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:43,310
I really wanna do Geezer-is now

807
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:44,550
Geezer-is, come on!

808
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:46,970
Steve

809
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:48,400
That's brutal! 1v1!

810
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,030
1v1

811
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:50,970
One more person

812
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:51,750
OK

813
00:44:52,770 --> 00:45:01,770
I'll kill Kaliopi even more! Kill, kill!

814
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:08,450
It's because I'm the Grim Reaper, right? This map...

815
00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:12,430
This map is crazy! Crazy, seriously!

816
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:13,770
Here comes the minecart again—

817
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:15,370
Where do you want to go?

818
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:16,650
Crazy! Crazy!

819
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:19,270
Toa's riding it!

820
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:21,949
Toa was on the minecart!

821
00:45:21,949 --> 00:45:23,330
She was just riding it...

822
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:25,050
Toa-chan!

823
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:28,650
Brutal!

824
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:33,410
This map, this map, Steve!

825
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:34,090
Too strong!

826
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:37,210
This place is insane! Wait, wait, wait!

827
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:38,210
I want to choose!

828
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:43,390
That's insane! Okay!

829
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:43,750
Oh!

830
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:44,930
You should have lived!

831
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:46,270
You should have lived!

832
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:53,000
Wait up!

833
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,660
Geez's Steak

834
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:57,820
Gee Heating Child

835
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:02,230
Amazing!

836
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:04,030
Strong!

837
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:07,970
Way too strong! That's good!

838
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:12,570
Team vibe! Team vibe!

839
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:14,490
Seriously, seriously—team vibe fight!

840
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:17,190
We're on the same team, so do your best!

841
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:18,030
Yeah, that's right!

842
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:20,250
Same team! We did it together, same team!

843
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:21,670
Lock in Gee!

844
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:29,490
Me Too Last Game

845
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:30,430
Okay!

846
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:31,510
Well then,

847
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:34,330
Me Too Last—go for it!

848
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:35,840
Do your best!

849
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,540
Do your best! I'll do my best!

850
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:46,050
Teo Galgon's pink color

851
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:49,510
Sweet color!

852
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:52,970
Crazy!

853
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:54,209
Bullets are crazy! Why?!

854
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:55,330
Right!

855
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:04,020
Yuka! Yu-chan!

856
00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:10,250
Scary! Scary!

857
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:11,550
Scary! Scary! Scary!

858
00:47:14,570 --> 00:47:15,870
My house!

859
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:21,720
Ouch!

860
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:33,700
Pikachu is crazy!

861
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:35,940
Shiny Pikachu is strong, right?

862
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:36,760
Dangerous! Dangerous!

863
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:40,110
Dangerous! Nooo!

864
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:43,070
Is it coming from behind?

865
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:44,750
Because it's a boomerang!

866
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:45,330
Crown!

867
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:49,150
I see!

868
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,570
Because I learned the move!

869
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:55,730
Crazy! Can I dodge it?

870
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:59,610
Even with the crown, maybe I can just guard it, right?

871
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:00,149
I can't see the guard!

872
00:48:00,149 --> 00:48:00,830
Absolutely!

873
00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:04,230
Wow!

874
00:48:04,810 --> 00:48:05,370
Alright, then—

875
00:48:05,370 --> 00:48:11,590
With this, the white hair will fall! Good job! Thank you! Thank you!

876
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:17,060
Of

877
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,270
course, yeah

878
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:21,040
let's go

879
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:22,180
Go go

880
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:24,650
Huh? Zeta?

881
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:25,990
If you beat him, is it Steve?

882
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:28,620
No, it's not Steve

883
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:31,130
It's Sans now! Oh—

884
00:48:31,790 --> 00:48:33,770
Simple is good!

885
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:41,800
Sans vs. Sephiroth

886
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:42,740
I'd love to see that!

887
00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:46,750
Let's go!

888
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,780
Sephiroth looks strong if you unlock him!

889
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:51,920
Sephiroth!

890
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:54,800
Ah—I'll do it!

891
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,220
Don't do it!

892
00:49:01,930 --> 00:49:02,890
Whoa!

893
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:04,110
Fireball!

894
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:06,710
Oh!

895
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:08,550
The old man's playing this game...

896
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:11,050
Someone's gonna smash it! LOL

897
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:19,380
Oh

898
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:20,330
Reiner

899
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:21,350
haha

900
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:27,410
She's hiding, haha

901
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:38,570
Laughing along

902
00:49:40,590 --> 00:49:42,150
please

903
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:03,230
Do you prefer someone with a long reach?

904
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:04,510
Yeah

905
00:50:06,330 --> 00:50:09,070
But I feel like Pikachu would be fine

906
00:50:09,330 --> 00:50:11,950
Love Pikachu, love Pikachu

907
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:13,550
It's simple

908
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:15,030
and I think it feels really good

909
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:16,710
Come on

910
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:19,930
Okay, of course, forever

911
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:22,390
Good, good

912
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:24,810
Please go ahead, second person

913
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:27,470
And then, and then

914
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:28,110
and then

915
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:29,330
and then, and then

916
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:31,850
I've already said it twice lol

917
00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:46,830
Sexy shirt vault hey hey hey gyowing

918
00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:48,170
Kyaa

919
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,200
You gotta guard properly

920
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:55,280
Wheeeeeeeeee 444

921
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:04,470
Staff, just a sec

922
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:07,900
Jiji’s in trouble, just a sec

923
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:11,220
Just a sec—ah, just a sec, no, this is bad

924
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:14,940
Just a sec, whoa whoa whoa

925
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:18,610
Let’s talk about Zeta

926
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,660
Can you use Guard?

927
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:28,219
Awesome

928
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:33,250
Maybe you should guard

929
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:36,829
Guard is important, guard is important

930
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:42,660
Surely he’ll come

931
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:44,120
Surely time

932
00:51:46,990 --> 00:51:48,310
You have to do it together with Zeta

933
00:51:48,310 --> 00:51:50,010
You have to match me

934
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:50,510
Okay, okay

935
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:51,750
I need to match too

936
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:53,230
Come back here

937
00:51:53,230 --> 00:51:54,850
Come back as an even cuter Pudding

938
00:51:54,850 --> 00:51:56,350
Okay, okay

939
00:51:56,350 --> 00:51:57,750
Okay, Pudding

940
00:51:57,750 --> 00:52:02,370
Cute cute character vs Sephiroth

941
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:04,100
Sephiroth

942
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,040
That seems kinda weird

943
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:07,880
Sephiroth

944
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:09,740
Maybe that’s not quite right

945
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:12,530
Pikachu, Pudding, Kabigon

946
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:13,280
Sephiroth

947
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,940
One cute team versus Sephiroth alone

948
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:51,579
Scary

949
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:53,840
Looks strong

950
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:58,860
What is this Pudding Pudding, that’s insane

951
00:52:58,860 --> 00:52:59,980
Zigglebar

952
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:03,300
It’s definitely not Stiff yet

953
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:09,070
Stiff Mine Cart

954
00:53:09,070 --> 00:53:15,290
Made of titanium

955
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:17,410
Tears, his mining power

956
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:19,850
Go check it out

957
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:24,020
Excitement

958
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:26,970
feeling

959
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:40,660
Who sold you the sharp from Sephrowatts?

960
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:41,390
No

961
00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:45,160
Who sold you the sharp, sha

962
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:52,090
arp—who sold you the sharp?

963
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:29,880
This is bad

964
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:30,360
ba

965
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:33,080
d

966
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:33,840
Wait a sec

967
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:35,260
This is bad, ah

968
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:37,130
Huh?

969
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:37,730
Huh?

970
00:54:38,749 --> 00:54:40,470
What is it?

971
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,100
Damn

972
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:50,060
Going all-in with just one Thunderbolt

973
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,900
Strong, huh? Yeah, really strong

974
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:56,820
Fuu-san, should we do that thing?

975
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:59,179
Make it the last one, the very last one

976
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:03,140
OK, last one, last one

977
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:06,140
Alright, go ahead, Zeta, please

978
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:07,740
Do your best

979
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:13,180
Shiori, will you do it with Zeta and Jiji? Last one, go ahead

980
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:16,860
I think that’d be better

981
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:17,760
Let’s take a quick look

982
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:19,550
Last one

983
00:55:22,270 --> 00:55:23,390
Do your best, Steve

984
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:27,440
Steve

985
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,420
Steve is totally giving it his all

986
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:31,400
Shuri, you do your best too

987
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:34,100
Steve is really strong

988
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:37,180
But what's important is

989
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:40,720
Aim for pitch-black Steve—it's dangerous

990
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:42,120
Wait a sec

991
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:45,620
Steve

992
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:45,860
Go!

993
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:47,160
Bye-bye

994
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:48,480
Steve, she's killing me

995
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:54,130
Oh no

996
00:55:55,379 --> 00:55:58,690
Oh no

997
00:55:58,690 --> 00:55:59,920
That's bad

998
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,420
Zeto-chan, your hair fell out

999
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:09,320
This bookmark is super strong

1000
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:10,850
Strong

1001
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:17,330
So strong

1002
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:28,300
Delicious, so delicious

1003
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:34,120
That was fun—thank you

1004
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:36,000
That was fun

1005
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:38,440
Well then

1006
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:42,900
Do your best for the real thing—practice hard

1007
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:46,140
I'll practice lots and lots

1008
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:52,800
Do your best—I believe in you! Leave it to me, leave it to me

1009
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,400
Thank you

1010
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:58,160
Thank you very much for watching today

1011
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:01,060
Shiori's team is

1012
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:02,220
Where are they?

1013
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:04,900
Raora

1014
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:22,420
I forgot—it's Team Bird, right? The bird team

1015
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:27,060
Chicken! Chicken, okay

1016
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:30,700
Team Chicken and Team Window, yes

1017
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:32,800
Team Wind

1018
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:35,180
Let's do our best

1019
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:36,800
Let's do it

1020
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:41,160
With that, great job everyone

1021
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:46,120
Great job! Great job!

1022
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:46,540
Great job

1023
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:51,880
Alright, great job!

1024
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:58,950
Great job! See you again—peace!
